By Christine Lagarde and Fabio Panetta
The way we pay is becoming increasingly digital. To ensure financial stability in this digital age, it is crucial that we all still have easy access to central bank money, which is the foundation of our currency. The digital euro can achieve that.
For many decades, we have had a successful model for payments. Central banks have provided the monetary base: cash for individuals and central bank deposits for banks – often referred to as “public money”. And the private sector has offered its own payment solutions – for instance giro payments or cards – that are based on commercial bank money, such as deposits. This is often called “private money”.
The stability of this hybrid model rests on private money being backed by public money. Money offered by private intermediaries can be converted to public money on a one-to-one basis at any time. In this way, public money serves as an anchor for the whole payment system.
But payments are now undergoing a potentially disruptive transformation. People are increasingly paying digitally instead of with cash. Cash cannot be used in e-commerce, and many physical stores also prefer cashless payments. During the pandemic, online and contactless payments surged.
This trend towards digital money is convenient for many of us and creates a wealth of opportunities for financial innovation and inclusion. But it also poses at least three risks.
First, if cash is used less and less, public money could ultimately lose its role as the monetary anchor in Europe. People’s trust that private money can always be converted into central bank money could be jeopardised, eventually damaging trust in the euro itself. And globally, the international role of the euro could be undermined, especially if other large economies introduce central bank digital currencies that can be used across borders.
A digital payment ecosystem without a strong monetary anchor would create confusion
Second, in such an environment, people’s demand for secure and riskless digital payments would have to be met by the private sector instead – but private providers cannot truly replicate the role of central bank money. A digital payments ecosystem without a strong monetary anchor would create confusion about what qualifies as money. Take crypto-assets, for example. They cannot guarantee one-to-one convertibility with central bank money. They are not an efficient means of payment, especially if their value is not backed by any asset. And, in the case of stablecoins, they are vulnerable to runs.
Third, digital private sector solutions tend to be dominated by a handful of providers that benefit from network effects, where the solutions they offer become more useful the more people use them. This dominance could be magnified by the ability of big tech companies to use their large existing customer bases to expand quickly, increasing the risk of market-abusive behaviour. And, as most of these companies are headquartered outside the European Union, it could exacerbate the risk of our European payments market being dominated by non-European solutions and technologies.
All this means that, if we are to preserve a stable and reliable payment system in Europe, we need to preserve the role of central bank money in the digital age.
That is why, one year ago, the ECB launched the digital euro project. A digital euro would be an electronic means of payment, issued by the central bank and accessible to everyone in the euro area.
A digital euro would complement cash – not replace it – by allowing central bank money to also be used in digital form. This would expand the availability of digital central bank money beyond its current use – for transactions between banks – to also include everyone’s daily payments.
Introducing a digital euro would ensure that citizens can continue to trust in the monetary anchor behind their digital payments. It would protect the strategic autonomy of European payments and monetary sovereignty, providing a fall-back solution if geopolitical tensions intensify.
A digital euro would also help to avoid market dominance, improve the efficiency of the payment system and foster innovation in the private sector. We could, for instance, allow intermediaries to offer innovative services based on the digital euro. This would make it easier to quickly roll out payment solutions across the entire euro area, and for smaller firms to offer more advanced services at competitive prices.
But the digital euro can only be successful if it becomes part of the everyday lives of Europeans. It must add value compared with existing solutions. What will that take? It is too early to decide on the details of the design. We expect to complete the investigation phase of our digital euro project in the autumn of 2023. But some key principles are already clear.
First, a digital euro must respond to the needs of its users. Research has shown that what users value most is wide acceptance, ease of use, low costs, high speed, security and consumer protection. Meanwhile, merchants, who also seek low costs and ease of use, want the digital euro to be integrated with existing systems.
Second, a digital euro should also benefit people who so far have limited access to digital payments and thereby support financial inclusion.
Third, the protection of privacy must be of the highest standard. People should be able to choose how much information they want to disclose – so long as they comply with prevailing laws.
There are also pitfalls to be aware of. The digital euro is intended as a means of payment, not as a form of investment. Otherwise too many commercial bank deposits could be moved to the central bank – a scenario which would make it more difficult for banks to lend to consumers and companies, and which could even generate tensions in the banking system during times of financial stress. Even though the take-up of a digital euro is likely to be gradual, safeguards should be provided from the outset.
The public sector, and central banks in particular, are responsible for preserving the integrity of the monetary and payment systems in the interests of citizens. A digital euro, if carefully designed and introduced, could play a decisive and beneficial role in this endeavour, serving as a public good for the transition of our society and economy into the digital age.

Just as the postage stamp became less relevant with the arrival of the internet and email, so too could cash lose relevance in a digital economy.
The use of cash in payments is declining as people increasingly prefer to pay digitally and shop online. In the euro area, half of consumers now prefer to pay with cashless means of payment. Online sales have doubled since 2015. If these trends continue, cash could lose its pivotal role.
This has implications for the key role of central bank money in payments. Today, it is widely used by households and businesses for consumer and person-to-person transactions in the form of cash, and by financial institutions for wholesale transactions in the form of electronic deposits.
But the role of cash is challenged by digitalisation, while the emergence of new technologies creates new possibilities for wholesale transactions. To continue playing its role as the anchor of the monetary system, central bank money will need to respond to evolving needs. This means that work on central bank digital currencies must be intensified.
Retail central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are about creating the possibility for everyone to use central bank money for digital retail payments. This is the focus of theECB’s projectto develop a digital euro.
Some people have argued that retail CBDCs would be redundant given the vast supply of private digital means of payments.
In my view, the opposite is true. The smooth functioning of payments, which is critical for monetary and financial stability, ultimately depends on sovereign money continuing to play its anchoring role in the digital era. So central banks must evolve with changing technologies, payment habits and financial ecosystems. Let me explain why.
We are accustomed to using different forms of money interchangeably. We are confident that “one euro is one euro” whatever form it takes, and this allows payment systems to run smoothly and commerce to flow.
But this “singleness” of money has not come about by chance. Confidence in private money – bank deposits, credit cards and e-payment solutions – rests on the ability to convert it, at par, into central bank money, which is the safest form of money available. Runs on private money start when this confidence disappears.
This is not to say that other safeguards, like banking regulation and supervision, deposit insurance and the monitoring function of capital markets, are not also important and effective. But they need to be complemented by the convertibility anchor as a basis for maintaining a well-functioning payments system and financial stability.
Without central bank money to provide an undisputed monetary anchor, people would have to monitor the soundness of private issuers in order to assess the value of each form of private money, undermining the “singleness” of the currency. Indeed, history has repeatedly shown us that different forms of private money coexisting in the absence of sovereign money leads to crises.
The primary policy objective of a digital euro would be to pre-empt such a situation. Retail CBDCs aim to ensure that public money remains widely accessible and usable for daily transactions.
The challenge is different for wholesale CBDCs. These already exist: central banks provide digital infrastructures for the settlement of transactions between banks in central bank money. In the case of the Eurosystem, these are its Target Services: Target2 for wholesale payments, Target2-Securities (T2S) for securities settlement, and Target Instant Payment Settlement (TIPS) for instant payments.
The widespread use of central bank money, as the safest and most liquid settlement asset for wholesale transactions, helps reduce risks to the financial system. In parallel to our work on a digital euro, we thus need to continually assess the need to upgrade the services we offer for the settlement of wholesale transactions. This is why we are working on consolidating the Target2 and T2S platforms.
The attractiveness of Target Services has recently been confirmed by the formal expression of interest to study further a migration to Target Services by the Danish Nationalbank and the Swedish Riksbank. The former has relied on T2S for several years and the latter has already decided to adopt TIPS.
By ensuring that central bank money remains the anchor of the payment system, we will support financial stability and trust in the currency. This is crucial to preserving the transmission of monetary policy and thus protecting the value of money.

We are entering the age of digital money. Much like commodity or representative money in the past, digital money is emerging in response to changes in society and technology.
Today, digitalisation is reaching all areas of our lives. The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has shown just how fast such change can happen. And this is affecting the way we pay. We are increasingly buying digitally and online. The role of cash as a means of payment is declining.
Private solutions for digital and online payments bring important benefits such as convenience, speed and efficiency. But they also pose risks in terms of privacy, safety and accessibility. And they can be expensive for some users. Digital payments are still used more by consumers with higher incomes, whereas the preference for cash is higher among those with lower incomes, reflecting its essential role for financial inclusion.
Central banks cannot ignore these developments. Over many centuries, the sovereign has provided its own currency to citizens as a symbol of stability, safety and trust. Providing money as a public good is central to the mission of central banks.
Given the digital transformation under way, which has the potential to transform the payments landscape and even the entire financial system, central banks must be bold and keep up with the pace of change.
Today, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank has therefore decided to formally launch a project to get ready for the possible issuance of a digital euro. In concrete terms, this means that we will commit the resources necessary to design a marketable product. But a decision about whether or not to issue a digital euro will only come at a later stage. And in any event, a digital euro would complement cash, not replace it.
The launch of this project today follows on from the exploratory work we have done so far.
Our first step – the Eurosystem’s report on a digital euro – laid the groundwork and identified the rationale for potentially issuing a digital euro.[1]
People living in the euro area have costless access to a safe and universally accepted means of payment in the form of cash. But this should also be true for digital and online payments. A digital euro would reduce the cost of transactions. It would foster financial inclusion by aiming to make digital payments available to those who currently don’t have access to financial services. And it would enable users to make their purchases across all outlets and countries in the euro area.
A digital euro would also provide safety. Just like cash, a digital euro would be a direct claim on the central bank and would therefore have no risk – no liquidity risk, no credit risk, no market risk.
Being offered by the central bank – which has no commercial interest in monetising the data of users – the digital euro would help to protect people’s privacy against commercial usage or unjustified intrusion. An appropriate, transparent governance set-up that complies with European regulation on data protection would further guarantee that users’ personal data are only accessible to legitimate authorities, with a view to preventing illicit activities such as money laundering or terrorist financing.
A digital euro would level the playing field and encourage innovation by enabling competing providers – large and small – to build on it. By providing services with “digital euro inside”, European intermediaries would be in a position to strengthen the services they offer to their customers and stay competitive even as global tech giants expand into payments and financial services. And central bank money would remain at the heart of the payment system, strengthening Europe’s autonomy in the age of digital money.
Our second step, after publishing the Eurosystem report, was to hold a public consultation. We received a record level of feedback, revealing a considerable interest from Europeans in these potential benefits. It also showed that the most important features of a digital euro for households and firms are privacy, security and broad usability.[2]
In parallel, together with the national central banks (NCBs) of the euro area, we conducted experimental work to assess the technological feasibility of a digital euro.
Our experimentation revealed that existing infrastructure, such as that used by the Eurosystem for instant payments – TARGET Instant Payment Settlement (TIPS) –, as well as distributed ledger technology, could be scaled up to process the roughly 300 billion retail transactions carried out in the euro area each year.
This experimental work also allowed us to identify possible options to protect privacy, ranging from segregating data to using cryptographic techniques.
And finally, our experiments showed that the energy needed by the settlement infrastructure we used is negligible compared with the energy consumption and environmental footprint of crypto-assets such as bitcoin, which uses more electricity than Greece or Portugal alone[3].
A summary of the main findings of our experimentation has been published today[4], and the detailed results will be shared by the NCBs in the coming weeks.
But while all these steps have shed light on the possibilities of a digital euro, many questions still need to be answered.
Money and payments permeate our everyday lives and underpin the economy. Any changes stemming from technological innovation, if not properly designed, can become a source of disruption for our financial systems, economies and societies.
Designing a new form of central bank money will involve defining operational and technological requirements and identifying the preferable options. For example, between possible ways to ensure that the digital euro is used as a means of payment rather than as a form of investment, with a view to preserving financial stability. Or between a centralised ledger, which could be easier and more efficient to handle, a distributed ledger, which may be better suited to peer-to-peer transactions, and/or local storage on a user’s device, which would enable offline payments. These aspects all have a bearing on one another. Making a coherent set of choices will be key to a smoothly functioning system.
This is the backdrop to our decision to launch a digital euro project, starting with two years of investigative work on the design that a digital euro should have. It will involve focus groups, interaction with financial intermediaries, prototyping and conceptual work. We will engage with all stakeholders. And we will continue to interact closely with other European institutions to define the necessary legislative framework. The European Parliament, the European Commission, the European Council and the Eurogroup have all recognised the importance of the digital euro for an innovative financial sector and resilient payment systems, and they have encouraged the Eurosystem to continue its work.[5]
Our aim is to be ready, at the end of these two years, to start developing a digital euro, which could take around three years.
A digital euro will be successful if it adds value for everybody involved – citizens, merchants and financial intermediaries. We want to design the digital euro to be such a success.
The Eurosystem will drive this project forwards with the necessary degree of caution, inherent in our mandate to provide stability – both monetary and financial. But we will not shy away from writing this new page of European progress.

The possibility of digitising the euro is setting high expectations. But it is also raising questions. At the ECB we take people’s concerns seriously, and are thus committed to clearing up any misunderstandings. There are currently three misconceptions about the digital euro. First, that the ECB intends to abolish cash and then, having done so, impose even lower interest rates on the digital euro for reasons related to how monetary policy is implemented. Second, that a digital euro would displace banking intermediation. And third, that the digital euro would not be based on a viable business model.
First of all, it is not yet decided whether a digital euro will be introduced at all. We are still exploring the possibility and considering it conceptually. Later this year, the ECB’s Governing Council will decide whether or not we should launch a project to get ready to issue a digital euro. Even if we decide to do so, it would simply mean that we want to be prepared. A decision to actually issue a digital euro would come at a later stage.
Central to all our discussions is the fact that a digital euro would be a means of payment that would complement cash, not replace it. Abolishing cash is not on the table, as ECB President Christine Lagarde and other members of the ECB Board and Governing Council have stated publicly on several occasions. Moreover, banknotes are legal tender under European primary law. And the ECB and the European Commission have both pledged support for the continued use of cash at the point of sale.
There is therefore no truth to the claim that the ECB is planning to impose significantly more negative interest rates via a digital euro. As long as there is cash, people can continue to hold it at an interest rate equal to zero. Hence, introducing a digital euro cannot make citizens worse off. The aim of the digital euro would be to offer citizens the possibility of using central bank money as a convenient way of paying digitally. It is not about monetary policy.
The concern that the ECB wants to draw significant amounts of customer deposits away from banks is also unfounded. We believe in the strong merits of allocating credit through private channels – banks and capital markets. So we have no intention of redesigning the European financial system. Customer deposits and the role of banks as lenders go hand in hand, and a digital euro would not challenge this. We have already expressed our views on possible ways in which the digital euro could be designed to prevent it becoming an investment vehicle that could undermine the role of banks in financial intermediation.
Instead, more attention should be paid to the stability risks if the ECB does not offer a digital currency. We must avoid a situation in which European payments are dominated by non-European providers, including by foreign tech giants potentially offering artificial currencies in the future. Not only could this threaten the stability of the financial system, but individuals and merchants alike would be vulnerable to a small number of dominant providers with strong market power.
Therefore, preparing for a digital euro also protects Europe’s autonomy. It represents a safeguard should undesirable scenarios materialise. Such scenarios are not around the corner, but citizens must be able to rely on the fact that the authorities responsible have such dangers on their radar and are arming themselves against them at an early stage.
It is understandable that some people do not see the benefits of a digital euro at present. But public institutions are responsible for looking at the challenges of the future and preparing well in advance. They must act with foresight in the interest of all, even though prevention does not always reap glory.
Unlike private companies or data-hungry tech firms, central banks do not seek to maximise profits. We have no interest in personal data or market dominance. The goal of a digital euro would be to provide Europeans with an alternative, modern, secure means of payment, backed by the commitment of an independent central bank to ensure its stability. It would work as a basis and integral component, not as a counter-design to modern payment services. The digital euro, if it were introduced, would respect privacy and would be available free of charge. Its availability would facilitate digital payments in all corners of the euro area.
Of course, this requires the digital euro to be user-friendly and widely adopted. The ECB is therefore committed to discussing the topic with industry representatives, academics and the broader public to really understand people’s needs and ensure the digital euro would be accepted.
This will take some time. But our responsibility to Europeans means that we must ensure our single currency is future-proof and fit for the digital age. Thoroughness is an essential part of our work.

Since the times of ancient Greece money has been virtually synonymous with cash: coins and later banknotes have provided people with an efficient and widely accepted means of payment for their everyday transactions.
In recent years, however, the digital revolution has led people to significantly change their payment habits – tapping a card, swiping a phone, or using a smartwatch to pay is becoming increasingly common.
A new study on the payment attitudes of consumers in the euro area (SPACE) conducted by the European Central Bank and national central banks reveals that almost half of euro area adults now prefer to pay digitally, and this trend appears to have accelerated further during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. While cash is still the most frequently used means of payment for in-person transactions, its share is decreasing. For remote purchases, cards and e-payments are the solutions of choice. And direct debits or credit transfers are the most common way of paying bills.
This contrasting evidence suggests that none of the means of payment currently available meets all consumer needs. This underlines the importance of continuing to give people a choice in how they pay, without compromising their expectations of fast, secure, low-cost and easy-to-use payments. Indeed, cash and digital money can be seen as mutually complementary: their coexistence offers greater choice and easier access to simple ways of paying for all groups in society, ensuring a high degree of inclusion and resilience in payments.
Digital money goes hand-in-hand with the digitalisation of the economy: it supports the growth of e-commerce and connected lifestyles, and satisfies people’s demand for immediacy and seamless integration between payments and digital services.
But even if digital payments are designed to be as robust as possible, they remain vulnerable to disruptions, such as power blackouts, cyber threats and technical failures. In such situations, cash can support resilience in payments: owing to its unique features, it provides a crucial backstop and a trusted store of value. Our payment survey shows that 34% of euro area citizens keep extra cash reserves at home for precautionary reasons.
Cash is also inclusive. A particular concern with digital payments is that, if they become the norm, citizens who are unable or unwilling – for example for privacy reasons – to use such services risk being excluded from the economy. Our payment survey reveals that cash is regularly used by citizens of all ages, all educational levels and all income groups. Moreover, cash is essential to ensure the inclusion of socially vulnerable citizens who may not have bank accounts or who lack the necessary digital skills. This highlights the need to maintain the smooth functioning of the cash cycle, including easy access to cash and wide acceptance of cash at points of sale. We therefore remain firmly committed to ensuring that cash remains widely available and accepted across the euro area.
At the same time, as consumers and private money go digital, sovereign money also needs to be reinvented so that the public good it provides remains fully available in the digital era. We therefore need to be ready to issue a digital equivalent to banknotes, should the need arise. A digital euro would complement cash: together they would offer access to simple, costless ways of paying. A digital euro would also be designed to be interoperable with private payment solutions, facilitating the provision of pan-European solutions and additional services to consumers. And the protection of privacy will be a key priority, so that the digital euro can help maintain trust in payments in the digital age. To further understand end users’ needs and concerns, we are inviting feedback from everyone as part of our ongoing public consultation on a digital euro.
Digitalisation has the potential to revolutionise payments. However, it is important that European households and businesses still have a choice. We are therefore working to ensure that a public, simple, costless and safe option remains available in all circumstances.

Digitalisation is spreading to all areas of our lives, satisfying an increasing demand for immediacy in how we consume, work and interact with each other. In many ways, it is disrupting our cultural, social and economic fabric.
The way we pay is no exception. Our practices are changing – in some countries rapidly so. Not long ago, cash was the only way to pay instantly. It is still the dominant payment method for small amounts. But the trend is towards cashless, contactless payments. We are increasingly making purchases using tap-and-go cards, an app on our phone or even a smartwatch.
As the guardians and issuers of their currencies, central banks around the world are inevitably asking themselves whether they should issue a digital currency. Should they devise an electronic form of money which is also legal tender, which commands the same degree of trust and which offers all the benefits of money in its traditional form? In the euro area, should we issue a digital euro alongside euro banknotes? We already have digital means of payment, such as electronic transfers. And, of course, we have physical central bank money in the form of cash. What we do not have is a digital currency that is issued by the central bank and that we can all use in daily life. In other words, we do not have a digital equivalent of euro banknotes.
Whether or not we need a digital euro is a fundamental and pressing question, and the ECB and the national central banks of the euro area are considering it together. We are publishing a report today on our assessment of the economic, strategic, technological and societal choices that we face. It will form the basis of a public consultation that we will launch on 12 October to hear the views of the public and interested stakeholders.
The report concludes that we should be ready to issue a digital euro if and when developments around us make it necessary. This means that we already need to be preparing for it. In the coming months, we will listen and experiment so that we are in a position to take a fully informed decision on the possible development and launch of a digital euro.
A digital euro would aim to preserve the public good that the euro provides to citizens: costless access to a simple, universally accepted, risk-free, trusted means of payment. Issuing a digital euro may become necessary in a variety of scenarios: think of situations where people no longer prefer paying with cash, or extreme events – such as natural disasters or pandemics – where other payment services no longer function. A digital euro would also protect us from the potential for a public or private digital means of payment, issued and controlled from outside the euro area, to largely displace existing means of payment, which could raise regulatory concerns and threaten financial stability or even our monetary and financial sovereignty.
A digital euro would complement cash, not replace it. Together, they would offer people greater choice and easier access to means of payment. This would help financial inclusion. A digital euro would also be a symbol of Europe’s willingness to embrace change and lead from the front, supporting the digitalisation of the European economy. It would promote innovation in retail payments, synergising with the new payment solutions that citizens and businesses need to prosper in innovative digital markets. It would make the euro more attractive to people living outside the euro area, thus increasing its global appeal and the strength of Europe’s financial system. Finally, it would allow to more effectively combat illegal activities, such as money laundering and the financing of terrorism.
The introduction of a digital euro also poses challenges. Some of these challenges are related to people’s individual rights, such as the right to privacy. We will have to resolve these issues when we develop functional and technological designs. Other challenges are economic in nature. For example, some people fear that a digital euro could hamper the activity of banks or generate instability in times of financial stress. But a properly designed digital euro could address these risks.
To face these challenges we must keep in mind that the value of money – in both traditional and digital forms – is rooted in citizens’ trust. Acceptance by the public is crucial. We therefore want to listen to people and learn about their needs, preferences and concerns with regard to a digital euro. The input we receive both in the public consultation and in discussions with Europeans’ elected representatives will guide our future work. We will test concrete options through experiments, in cooperation with all stakeholders. And we will liaise with the relevant institutions and authorities as we assess the legal, economic and financial requirements of a digital euro.
The euro has done well so far, providing a currency that Europeans trust. We need to make sure that our currency is fit for the future. Inaction is not an option.

Blog post by Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB
Trading in unbacked digital assets should be treated by regulators like gambling.
Last year marked the unravelling of the crypto market as investors moved from the fear of missing out to the fear of not getting out.
TerraUSD — a stablecoin that was stable in name only — was among the first to fall in a chain of collapses that brought down several lending platforms, a hedge fund, a leading crypto asset exchange and most recently a large US-listed crypto mining company. Other crypto companies are likely to be added to this list in the coming months.
These failures occurred in rapid succession, reflecting crypto players’ incredibly high leverage, their interconnectedness across the crypto ecosystem and their inadequate governance structures.
Yet remarkably, the crypto market rout has left the financial system largely unscathed. Many therefore think it preferable tolet crypto burnrather than regulate at the risk of legitimising cryptos. Let me voice two important reservations about this view.
First, despite theirfundamental flaws, it is not certain that crypto assets will ultimately self-combust.
Take unbacked crypto assets, for instance. They do not perform any socially or economically useful function: they are rarely used for payments and do not fund consumption or investment. As a form of investment, unbacked cryptos lack any intrinsic value, too. They are speculative assets. Investors buy them with the sole objective of selling them on at a higher price. In fact, they are a gamble disguised as an investment asset.
But it is precisely for this reason that we cannot expect them to disappear. People have always gambled in many different ways. And in the digital era, unbacked cryptos are likely to continue to be a vehicle for gambling.
This year’s crypto market meltdown caught millions of investors off guard.
Second, the cost to society of an unregulated crypto industry is too high to ignore. For one,this year’s crypto market meltdown caught millions of investors off guard. Uninformed investors were left with significant losses. It is not just cryptos that are being burnt.
In addition, unregulated cryptoassets can be used for tax evasion, money laundering, terrorist financing and the circumvention of sanctions. They also have high environmental costs.
That is why we cannot afford to leave cryptos unregulated. We need to build guardrails that address regulatory gaps and arbitrage and tackle the significant social costs of cryptos head-on.
This is easier said than done. Regulators must walk a tightrope. Like Ulysses, they must resist the beguiling crypto sirens to avoid falling prey to the industry’s intense lobbying. And on their journey, they must steer clear of the Scylla of poor regulation and the Charybdis of legitimising unsound crypto models.
The EU’sRegulation on Markets in Crypto-Assetsis an important step. It is crucial that it is implemented as soon as possible. However, further work needs to be done to ensure that all segments of the industry are regulated, including decentralised finance activities such as crypto asset lending or non-custodial wallet services.
In addition, regulation should acknowledge the speculative nature of unbacked cryptos and treat them as gambling activities. Vulnerable consumers should be protected through principles similar to thoserecommendedby the European Commission for online gambling. They should be taxed in accordance with the costs they impose on society.
To avoid the risk of regulation lagging behind because of the time needed for legislative processes, regulators and supervisors need to be empowered to keep pace with crypto developments.
And to be effective and prevent regulatory arbitrage, regulation must have a global reach. Therecommendationsof the Financial Stability Board for the regulation and oversight of crypto asset activities and markets should be finalised and applied urgently, as should therulesrecently published by the Basel Committee for the treatment of banks’ exposures to cryptos.
However, regulation and taxation alone will not be sufficient to address the shortcomings of cryptos. To build solid foundations for the digital finance ecosystem, we need a risk-free and dependable digital settlement asset, which can only be provided by central bank money.
