Anticipating the environment in which the digital euro will be
introduced
The methodology requires specifying different scenarios to assess the impact of
the digital euro. Key considerations to incorporate into the analysis are:
• Anticipating how the financial sector might change, including how
digitalisation is reshaping it (e.g., change in deposit stickiness, instant
payments, stablecoins, etc)
• Evaluating the usage of cash going forward
• Anticipating the liquidity environment, making the methodology robust to
future evolutions (e.g. to less ample central bank liquidity)
5 www.ecb.europa.eu ©ECB-PUBLIC
Common assumptions
Hypothetical digital euro introduction under different holding limits and scenarios
• Range of holding limits
1. As per SSM data collection bucketing for retail deposits in Significant
Institutions (SIs)
• Scenarios for deposit outflows (as also suggested by ERPB members)
1. Business-as-usual: contained deposit outflows – digital euro as a means of
payment
2. Flight-to-safety: system-wide outflows due to a loss of confidence in the
banking system (unrelated to digital euro and abstracting from crisis reaction by
ECB)
Nota bene: Idiosyncratic bank run already feasible and even faster due to digitalisation, so not
specifically modelled given limited marginal impact of digital euro
6 www.ecb.europa.eu ©ECB-PUBLIC
Scenarios for deposit outflows
Sample: Q1 2024, 2009 banks, of which 112 SIs and 1897 LSIs* from SSM supervisory data**
and ad-hoc SSM Distribution of Retail Deposits data for 98 SIs (i.e., those with retail deposits)
Deposit outflows under business-as-usual
Predicted based on digital euro demand estimates/scenarios (building on Lambert, et al., 2024, to be further refined
with data points coming from Block 1, see slide 9)
• SIs: estimated average digital euro holdings multiplied by number of unique eligible sight depositors and adjusted for
depositor balances (by bucket, based on SSM data)
• LSIs: projected share of deposit outflows of small market lenders (to be further refined with ongoing LSI data collection)
Deposit outflows under flight-to-safety
Maximum possible outflows of retail sight deposits
• SIs: maximum eligible retail sight deposits based on current bucketed balances and adjusted for (est.) multiple accounts
and shared accounts (by bucket, based on SSM data)
• LSIs: maximum share of deposit outflows possible of small market lenders (to be further refined with LSI data)
*LSIs = Less Significant Institutions

**COREP/FINREPECB-PUBLIC
Block 1: Usability – objectives and tools
Study users’ ability to make payments with digital euro, i.e. cover their
consumption, under different holding limits
We use survey data from the Household Finance and Consumption survey to analyse the
consumption distribution (and complement this with analysis on income, following feedback by
ERPB members)
We follow a two-step approach
1. We include a) “amount spent on consumer goods and services” (covering utilities, food,
childcare, and health care expenses); b) “expenses on trips and holidays” and “amount
given as alimony, charity etc.” (each adjusted in terms of monthly and individual
expenditures).*
2. We additionally include additional funds available for individual consumption and add
them to step 1 (to include additional potential use cases for digital euro spending).
* Work in progress: rent, loan repayments, and mortgage payments currently not included - expected to significantly increase individual
monthly consumption.
8 www.ecb.europa.eu ©ECB-PUBLIC
Block 1: Usability – objectives and tools (cont.)
Investigate user preferences, esp. in terms of pre-funding over reverse waterfall
(including heterogeneity across users)
We conduct ad-hoc survey on users’ behaviour and their money demand to tackle structural
difficulties in comprehending user behaviour.
Critical (as also noted by ERPB members) but challenging, due to the inability to directly
compare with traditional payment methods and the fact that user behaviour is not only
heterogeneous but also evolves over time:
• results can be used to cross-check the monthly expenses figures and provide further
data points that can help model the scenarios
Survey is representative of the euro area population: individuals aged 18+, targeting 1,000
individuals per euro area country (with three countries involving 500 respondents).
Respondents are provided with basic information about the digital euro, helping participants
provide informed responses.
9 www.ecb.europa.eu ©ECB-PUBLIC
Block 2: Monetary policy – objectives and tools
Analyse impact of digitalisation on demand for banknotes, so to understand
possible substitution between the two
We analyse key trends (using macro data and the SPACE* survey) to inform about the ""likely""
value of conversion of banknotes into digital euro. Key aspects to consider:
• So far, progressive and moderate return of banknotes to bank deposits due to the
increasing digitalisation of transactions.
• Potential future impact of digitalisation on storage of value (e.g. role of stablecoins),
complex to assess.
We use a Bayesian vector autoregression (BVAR) model to identify key drivers of banknote
holdings growth:
– looking at factors that are typically linked to storage of value: opportunity costs (-),
uncertainty (+), liquidity (+)
– And considering that storage of value accounts for most of the banknote stock.
*SPACE = Study on Payment Attitudes of Consumers in the Euro area
10 www.ecb.europa.eu ©ECB-PUBLIC
Block 2: Monetary policy – objectives and tools (cont.)
Analyse impact on loan supply due to bank balance sheet adjustments
We look at two channels
– changes in funding costs and profitability (input obtained from block 3)
– evolution of reserves
We adapt models currently used from regular policy work on loan supply
– Macroeconometric time series model (BVAR) estimated on the euro area (e.g. quarterly
GDP, inflation, loans to non-financial corporations, change in credit standards (BLS),
etc).
– Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium models calibrated on the euro area (e.g. based
on Darracq Pariès et al., 2011)
– Microeconometric estimates
Derive estimates robust to model and estimation uncertainty, complemented by meta-
analysis of the literature
11 www.ecb.europa.eu ©ECB-PUBLIC
Block 2: Monetary policy – objectives and tools (cont.)
Analyse impact stemming from the creation of new liquidity-absorbing autonomous
factor on relative position of euro short-term rate (€STR) in the rate corridor
We evaluate €STR implications across projected Eurosystem balance sheet scenarios,
accounting for the ECB’s new operational framework announced in March 2024
We estimate paths for banks’ (excess) liquidity holdings after deposits outflows (see
common assumptions).
Impact depends on the amount of liquidity:
– provided via structural operations (see discussion in slide 5)
– demanded by banks via borrowing through standard refinancing operations (i.e. short-
term central bank funding). Borrowing is estimated conditional on liquidity already
provided though structural operations (see above)
The impact also depends on the specific parameters and assumptions used in the scenarios
12 www.ecb.europa.eu ©ECB-PUBLIC
Block 2: Monetary policy – objectives and tools (cont.)
Analyse collateral availability and scarcity for given deposit outflows
We inquire (as also requested by ERPB members) whether banks hold enough unencumbered
eligible assets after haircuts to obtain, in response to deposit outflows,
• central bank funding simulated as described in Block 3 (bank level, using supervisory data)
• excess liquidity holdings estimated as described on previous slide (aggregate level)
We assess if collateral encumbrance could lead to collateral scarcity, by:
• analysing collateral / government bond encumbrance on aggregate, assuming all deposit
outflows are replaced by secured funding
• determining prevailing Eurosystem footprint in government bond markets - assets previously
held/pledged - using detailed market data;
• We compare encumbrance level and new Eurosystem footprint against historical benchmarks.
13 www.ecb.europa.eu ©ECB-PUBLIC
Block 3: Financial stability and banking supervision - objectives
and tools
Analyse the impact on banks’ liquidity
We simulate banks’ reaction to deposit outflows using a constrained balance sheet optimization
model (Meller and Soons, 2023)
Dataset:
• We use bank-level data for 112 SIs and 1897 LSIs from COREP/FINREP,
• We combine data with SSM-administered data for 98 SIs on deposit distribution and internal
liquidity target, to be further augmented with LSIs data in the future (see slide 7)
For a given outflow of retail deposits, a bank chooses its balance sheet adjustment with the aim of
maximizing profits by solving:

Abstracting from other potential responses, under the model, the bank chooses between :

The model allows for testing various types of scenarios where different assumptions on
the different parameters can be assessed:

monetary policy
Model output consists of bank-level adjusted balance sheets after digital euro demand

2024-12-10 – ERPB - Annex to preliminary methodology for holding limit
calibration
As part of the digital euro project, the ECB is working with experts from the national central banks of
the Eurosystem and national competent authorities to develop a methodology for setting digital euro
holding limits, balancing user experience with monetary policy and financial stability implications. This
work will allow the ECB to determine the factors to be considered in the calibration, and to propose a
methodology to calibrate the digital euro holding limits. It includes consultation with market participants
through the European Retail Payments Board (ERPB members). This annex to ECB presentation
delivered on 10 December 20241 provides a detailed description of the tools being developed for Blocks
1 and 3 and aims to collect feedback from ERPB members on these tools.
This working document has not been adopted or endorsed by ECB decision making bodies and
therefore any views expressed shall not, under any circumstances, be regarded as an official position
of the ECB. This content is intended solely to facilitate discussions and feedback by experts from the
ERPB associations to be provided to the ECB digital euro project team.
Block 1: Usability - tools in detail
Consumption and income analysis
The consumption analysis encompasses an assessment of consumption patterns both at the euro area
level and on a country-specific basis, capturing national heterogeneity. This analysis relies on data from
the HFCS2, which collects detailed household-level data on finances and consumption. In detail, the
analysis of the consumption distribution is conducted using a two-step approach.
In the first step, key expenditure categories such as spending on consumer goods and services (e.g.,
utilities, food, childcare, and healthcare), travel, holidays, and regular payments (e.g., alimony and
charitable donations) are considered. These expenditures are adjusted to reflect monthly individual
spending. In the second step, the funds available for individual consumption are added to the
consumption calculated in the first step. These funds are primarily represented by the available balance,
defined as the difference between monthly income and monthly consumption computed in step one.
Rent and mortgage payments are excluded from the available balance. This step helps account for
additional potential use cases for digital euro spending that would not be captured otherwise. For
instance, additional potential use cases for digital euro spending could include subscriptions to private
services, such as streaming platforms, as well as expenditures on leisure activities beyond holidays
and travel, like entertainment, recreational sports, or cultural events. The inclusion of such category is
ultimately leading to a more comprehensive estimate of potential monthly liquidity needs for
consumption. Currently, the analysis excludes rent, loan repayments, and mortgage payments due to
1See ECB, Update on work on methodology for holding limit calibration – agenda item 3.
2 See ECB, Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS).
1WORKING DOCUMENT - PRELIMINARY– FOR FEEDBACK ONLY
data quality and data limitations. If included, these expenses would be expected to significantly increase
the calculated individual monthly consumption.
A complementary dimension of the analysis, which has also been examined in other jurisdictions3 and
introduced based on the feedback by ERPB members, relates to the feasibility of individuals to receive
their income directly into their digital euro account. Understanding whether holding limits could
potentially interfere with individuals’ ability to seamlessly receive, store, and use their income is another
element for further refining a holding limit that aligns with users' needs. The analysis of the income
distribution incorporates all key variables related to various income sources collected from the HFCS.
In calculating the individual monthly income, the analysis takes into account economically active
household members, including pensioners receiving any form of income. This monthly income is then
converted into net income by applying the appropriate income tax rates and social security
contributions, using data from both the HFCS dataset and the OECD. The resulting net monthly income
is further supplemented by the balance carried over from the previous month, which is defined as the
difference between monthly income and monthly consumption, as calculated earlier in step one.
Importantly, the balance from the previous month excludes rent and mortgage payments due to data
quality and data limitations.
Ad-hoc survey on users’ behaviour and their money demand
The analysis is augmented by conducting a new dedicated survey on user behaviour regarding holding
digital euro, performed by an external service provider. This approach aims to tackle structural
difficulties in comprehending user behaviour, which is critical but challenging to predict due to the
inability to directly compare with traditional payment methods (such as physical cash or cashless
payments using commercial bank money) and the fact that user behaviour is not only heterogeneous
but also evolves over time. While exercises like this survey have structural limitations due to the inherent
difficulty in capturing preferences over hypothetical questions about something not yet fully known to
users (such as the digital euro), the findings could be used to refine the methodology. For instance, its
results can be used to cross-check the monthly expenses figures and provide further data points that
can help model the scenarios.
Methodologically, the survey is representative of the euro area population and has been tested in a pilot
to ensure participants fully understand the questions. The survey is designed to be concise (20-minutes
duration) and incudes the provisions of stimuli. Respondents are provided with basic information about
the digital euro to ensure they are well-equipped to answer all questions. This information is shared
gradually, allowing for easier comprehension. Sufficient context and stimulus material is offered to help
participants provide informed responses. This includes context on the rationale behind the holding limit.
Finally, the service provider employs scenario-based descriptions to transit from abstract theoretical
questions about unfamiliar experiences to more relatable experiences.
The overall survey is composed of 21 relatively simple questions and recruits a representative sample
of participants aged 18 and above, targeting 1,000 individuals per euro area country, with three
countries (Malta, Luxembourg, and Cyprus) involving 500 respondents.

Block 3: Financial stability and banking supervision - tools in detail
The balance sheet optimization model closely follows Meller and Soons (2023), which was previously
published as an ECB Occasional Paper. This more detailed model description can be found in Meller
and Soons (2024).
Model environment
The model considers a one-period model economy with many profit-maximising banks, each differing
in their balance sheets: their level of reserve holdings, deposits, collateral, and liquidity risk profiles.
Each bank re-optimises its balance sheet under the expectation that an amount of its retail
deposits will

ways, each with a different impact on their constraints: 1) by drawing down their current central bank
reserves or banknotes, 2) by increasing central bank borrowing, and 3) by obtaining additional central
bank reserves on the interbank market.4
On the interbank market, each bank i can choose from a variety of funding options offered by bank ,
either unsecured or secured against unencumbered High-Quality Liquid Asset (HQLA) : short-term

4 As explained in Adalid et al. (2022), there is a fourth option which we do not consider as the added value is limited: the bank
could sell assets. A bank can only obtain additional reserves if it sells asset to another bank or a client of another bank. The
subsequent redistribution of reserves and impacts on the various constraints (collateral, LCR, NSFR) are very similar to those
resulting from secured interbank market funding. Therefore, explicitly incorporating this adjustment option does not yield
additional insights.

The impact of digital euro demand on banks’ cost of funding and net interest income
What happens to bank i’s funding costs? The introduction of a digital euro is assumed to lead to a
decrease in bank i’s retail deposits, . Consequently, bank i might need to raise reserves by
increasing its interbank or central bank f 𝛥𝛥u 𝐷𝐷n𝑖𝑖ding. This leads to a change in bank i’s cost of funding,

it also ensures that no more reserves are used by the banking sector than available on aggregate. If a
bank uses reserves to meet its costumers’ demand for digital euro, irrespective of whether they are its
own reserves or those borrowed from another bank on the interbank market, there is a decline in the
available excess reserves in the system.
Constraints (3) – (4) represent the collateral constraints (see also below). It is denoted with the
market value of unencumbered HQLA collateral of bank that can be pledged on the interbank m 𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖a𝑖𝑖r ket
or at the central bank and denotes the market value of unencumbered non-HQLA central bank

banks have a limited stock of each category of HQLA collateral suited to obtaining secured market and
𝑙𝑙 𝑖𝑖
central bank funding. Collateral in secured lending is subject to a haircut. To easy notation, It is assumed
in the model presentation that haircuts are the same on the interbank market and at the central bank.
However, when the model is run, these haircuts will in fact differ. The haircuts are defined such that a
haircut of 0.05 (5%) means that €100 of collateral would provide €95 in secured funding. Constraint (4)
reflects that each bank only has a limited stock of each category of non-HQLA central bank eligible
collateral. HQLA from non-HQLA collateralised central bank funding it are separated as it allows to
judge how important it is for the central bank to offer a broad collateral framework in case of a digital
euro introduction.
Regulatory liquidity ratios
Banks must meet two regulatory liquidity requirements: the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and the Net
Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR). The LCR mandates that the market value of a bank’s HQLA, which can
be monetised on short notice, exceeds its expected net outflows within a 30-day stress period. Expected
outflows are calculated by multiplying the liabilities of a bank with a liability specific “run off rate”. HQLA
holdings are based on the market value of HQLAs adjusted by an “LCR factor” which can be interpreted
as a regulatory haircut on assets to account for market/liquidation risks. The NSFR ensures that the
bank maintains sufficient Available Stable Funding (ASF) compared to its Required Stable Funding
(RSF). The NSFR is calculated based on “factors reflecting supervisory assumptions assigned to the
bank’s sources of funding and to its exposures, with these factors reflecting the liquidity characteristics
of each category of instruments” (BIS, 2014). In practice, a bank’s ASF is calculated as the sum of the
bank’s liabilities multiplied by a regulatory “ASF factor”, where unsecured, short-term funding obtains a
0% factor and funding above one year a factor of 100%. A bank’s RSF is the sum of the market value
of a bank’s (encumbered) asset holdings multiplied by an “RSF factor”, which is 0% for reserves, the
most liquid asset, and 100% for all assets that are encumbered for a period of one year or more.
Constraints (6) and (7) of the bank’s optimisation problem ensure that each bank continues to meet its
LCR and NSFR requirements and possibly sustain a bank-specific voluntary liquidity. The regulatory
requirements constrain both, the bank’s set of feasible borrowing and the set of feasible lending options.
Regarding the latter, a bank is not able to act as a lender on the interbank market if this would increase
its liquidity risk beyond its preferred level.
5WORKING DOCUMENT - PRELIMINARY– FOR FEEDBACK ONLY
An important input in our model is the extent to which banks are willing and allowed and willing to
deplete their liquidity buffers. In Q1 2024, the observed LCR and NSFR values in our sample range
from just above the regulatory minimum (100%) to more than ten times the regulatory minimum. The
observed variation of liquidity buffers likely reflects persistent heterogeneous liquidity risk preferences.
It is likely that banks with high voluntary liquidity buffers would prefer to maintain relatively high buffers
following a digital euro introduction.
Rather than assuming that all banks would be willing to reduce their liquidity buffer by the same absolute
amount, we assume that in the business-as-usual scenario SIs are only willing to deplete their liquidity
buffers to their internal liquidity targets, as reported in the SSM data collection. Since for LSIs we lack
the data, we assume that they are willing to deplete the same share of their current liquidity buffers as
the SIs with the business model of small market lenders. In the flight-to-safety scenario, we assume
that banks are willing to deplete their liquidity buffers until the regulatory minimum.

The LCR numerator, i.e., the unencumbered HQLA stock, is impacted by the digital euro-induced
changes to the bank’s balance sheet in two ways. First by a decrease in reserves: the unencumbered
HQLA stock is reduced either by drawing down own reserves to deal with own deposit outflows or by
lending out reserves on the interbank market. Second by secured borrowing or lending: the
unencumbered HQLA stock decreases when the bank borrows against HQLAs and unencumbered
HQLAs received in secured transactions may be considered as part of the stock of HQLA. Note that,
although similar in spirit, there can be a difference between “ ” of a HQLA and its

one year or more their new RSF factor is 100%. Second, the required stable funding increases for a
bank which lends on the interbank market since loans to financial institutions increase the required
stable funding. Third, the newly obtained collateral in repo transactions receives a RSF factor, which
depends on the type of collateral. Thus, the change is given by:

The interbank market
In our baseline model specification, the interbank market is perfectly competitive and frictionless. The
demand for each type of interbank loan is satisfied by a lender, but only if there is an unconstrained
bank with sufficient excess reserves available to be lent out. Recall that, when a bank borrows reserves
on the interbank market, the liquidity ratios of both the borrowing and lending bank are affected.
Constraints (7)-(14) represent the market clearing conditions for each type of funding. These conditions
imply that, in addition to its own reserves, collateral and liquidity constraints, each bank’s interbank
borrowing or lending choices must also be consistent with aggregate market clearing conditions.

The model does not explicitly conside𝑖𝑖r th𝑖𝑖 at banks can𝑖𝑖 ob𝑖𝑖 tain liquidity from other private entities such
as non-banks. The reason is that the impact on the distribution of reserves across banks is the same
whether reserves are exchanged directly between banks or indirectly at the request of a (non-bank)
customer of a bank. If a bank borrows from a non-bank, reserves are transferred from the bank where
the non-bank holds its deposit (Bank B) to the borrowing bank (Bank A). This lowers the reserves at
Bank B and increases the reserves at Bank A, just as it would if Bank A had borrowed directly from
Bank B. The impact on its LCR for Bank A is also the same. For Bank B, the LCR impact is very similar
if the alternative interbank funding would have been unsecured with a maturity of less than 30 days.
Solution algorithm
This section briefly explains the solution algorithm. First, each bank’s profit-maximizing balance sheet
adjustment is maximised subject to its reserve, liquidity, and collateral constraints. This balance sheet
8WORKING DOCUMENT - PRELIMINARY– FOR FEEDBACK ONLY
adjustment consists of (a mix of) reserve depletion and/or secured and unsecured funding options, with
different maturities and with specific collateral assets becoming encumbered. In the next step, market
clearing conditions are accounted for. On the interbank market, all banks that want to borrow receive
reserves accordingly if there is sufficient liquidity in the interbank market. The funding comes from and
is split evenly across all banks which are willing to lend. Banks are willing to lend if they have sufficient
reserves and if lending will not decrease their liquidity ratios below their preferred levels. The balance
sheets and liquidity ratios of both the borrower and the lender are adjusted to account for the
transaction. If no bank is willing to satisfy the demand for a specific funding option, the initial optimisation
that determines the profit maximizing balance sheet adjustment is re-run with this funding option
excluded. This process continues until all the interbank market clears or until no more bank is willing to
lend on the interbank market. At this point, banks can only manage additional outflows by depleting
their own reserves or by obtaining central bank funding.
Banks’ reaction: Impact on profitability
The analysis is further complemented by an assessment of the effect on Net Interest Income (NII),
which has been introduced also in view of the feedback received in the context of the ERPB discussion.
NII captures the possible changes in interest income and expense due to changes in banks’ balance
sheets in response to deposit outflows
The impact of the digital euro introduction on banks’ net interest income is assessed by considering the
changes in interest income and interest expense for each balance sheet item due to the deposit
outflows. More specifically, changes in interest income and expenses are determined by considering
changes in the volumes of the various banks’ balance sheet items. As detailed above, banks respond
to deposit outflows adjusting the composition of their balance sheets. More specifically, in this
framework banks can change interbank assets and liabilities, central bank funding and reserves. These
changes are an outcome of the balance sheet optimization model and are multiplied by the
corresponding interest rates. Interest rates for each balance sheet item are calibrated at the bank level
and are assumed to remain constant. In the main analysis, we use interest rates from Q1 2024, while
sensitivity analyses are conducted for different periods to assess how varying interest rate environments

Data and sample
The analysis relies on data collected via FINREP and COREP templates, which are part of the
European Banking Authority’s supervisory reporting requirements. These datasets provide
comprehensive financial and prudential information on banks. The baseline scenario is based on a
sample of 2009 euro area banks from the first quarter of 2024. The sample includes all supervised
institutions in the euro area. The data includes detailed information on the asset and liability composition
of each bank. The analysis uses information on banks’ deposits holdings, reserve and banknotes
holdings, regulatory liquidity ratios, market value of different types of HQLA and central bank eligible
collateral.
This information set has been complemented by an ad-hoc data collection exercise that the SSM has
carried out in July 2024 with 98 Significant Institutions (those with retail deposits). This dataset - with
reference date 31 March 2024 - included granular data on information of the distribution of retail
deposits held by natural persons eligible to hold digital euros, on a consolidated level. In line with the
feedback received from market participants regarding the factors to be considered, this data collection
has incorporated data on banks’ internal liquidity targets. The data collection adheres to the regulatory
reporting framework as much as possible and uses COREP ALM to complement this information and
perform the necessary robustness checks.
Overall, the SSM data collection included two pillars of information: i) liquidity targets and ii) distribution
of retail deposits (sight, term, and savings) disaggregated in 12 buckets or thresholds for volume of
deposits, number of depositors and deposit accounts, respectively. The data also includes for each
range and institution the average deposit rates paid by banks to depositors. Finally, the data includes a
breakdown to determine the volume of deposits covered by deposit guarantee schemes or deemed as
“stable” for supervisory purposes. This is done to gauge the level of “stickiness” of retail deposits across
the entire sample.
As of beginning of December 2024, the Less Significant Institutions (LSIs) data collection had been
triggered for 185 banks in all Eurosystem countries – aiming to finalize robustness checks by end of the
year. The same data template has been used as for Significant Institutions to foster harmonized results
across both exercises (Significant Institutions and Less Significant Institutions).

Good afternoon, the Vice-President and I welcome you to our press conference.
The Governing Council today decided to lower the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points.In particular, the decision to lower the deposit facility rate – the rate through which we steer the monetary policy stance – is based on our updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission.
The disinflation process is well on track. Staff see headline inflation averaging 2.4 per cent in 2024, 2.1 per cent in 2025, 1.9 per cent in 2026 and 2.1 per cent in 2027 when the expanded EU Emissions Trading System becomes operational. For inflation excluding energy and food, staff project an average of 2.9 per cent in 2024, 2.3 per cent in 2025 and 1.9 per cent in both 2026 and 2027.
Most measures of underlying inflation suggest that inflation will settle at around our two per cent medium-term target on a sustained basis. Domestic inflation has edged down but remains high, mostly because wages and prices in certain sectors are still adjusting to the past inflation surge with a substantial delay.
Financing conditions are easing, as our recent interest rate cuts gradually make new borrowing less expensive for firms and households.But they continue to be tight because our monetary policy remains restrictive and past interest rate hikes are still transmitting to the outstanding stock of credit.
Staff now expect a slower economic recovery than in the September projections. Although growth picked up in the third quarter of this year, survey indicators suggest it has slowed in the current quarter. Staff see the economy growing by 0.7 per cent in 2024, 1.1 per cent in 2025, 1.4 per cent in 2026 and 1.3 per cent in 2027. The projected recovery rests mainly on rising real incomes – which should allow households to consume more – and firms increasing investment. Over time, the gradually fading effects of restrictive monetary policy should support a pick-up in domestic demand.
We are determined to ensure that inflation stabilises sustainably at our two per cent medium-term target. We will follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate monetary policy stance. In particular, our interest rate decisions will be based on our assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. We are not pre-committing to a particular rate path.
The decisions taken today are set out in apress releaseavailable on our website.
I will now outline in more detail how we see the economy and inflation developing and will then explain our assessment of financial and monetary conditions.
The economy grew by 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, exceeding expectations. Growth was driven mainly by an increase in consumption, partly reflecting one-off factors that boosted tourism over the summer, and by firms building up inventories. But the latest information suggests it is losing momentum. Surveys indicate that manufacturing is still contracting and growth in services is slowing. Firms are holding back their investment spending in the face of weak demand and a highly uncertain outlook. Exports are also weak, with some European industries finding it challenging to remain competitive.
The labour market remains resilient. Employment grew by 0.2 per cent in the third quarter, again by more than expected. The unemployment rate remained at its historical low of 6.3 per cent in October. Meanwhile, demand for labour continues to weaken. The job vacancy rate declined to 2.5% in the third quarter, 0.8 percentage points below its peak, and surveys also point to fewer jobs being created in the current quarter.
The economy should strengthen over time, although more slowly than previously expected. The rise in real wages should strengthen household spending. More affordable credit should boost consumption and investment. Provided trade tensions do not escalate, exports should support the recovery as global demand rises.
Fiscal and structural policies should make the economy more productive, competitive and resilient. It is crucial to swiftly follow up, with concrete and ambitious structural policies, on Mario Draghi’s proposals for enhancing European competitiveness and Enrico Letta’s proposals for empowering the Single Market. We welcome the European Commission’s assessment of governments’ medium-term plans for fiscal and structural policies, as part of the EU’s revised economic governance framework.Governments should now focus on implementing their commitments under this framework fully and without delay. This will help bring down budget deficits and debt ratios on a sustained basis, while prioritising growth-enhancing reforms and investment.
Annual inflation increased to 2.3 per cent in November according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, from 2.0 per cent in October. The increase was expected and primarily reflected an energy-related upward base effect. Food price inflation edged down to 2.8 per cent and services inflation to 3.9 per cent. Goods inflation went up to 0.7 per cent.
Domestic inflation, which closely tracks services inflation, again eased somewhat in October. But at 4.2%, it remains high. This reflects strong wage pressures and the fact that some services prices are still adjusting with a delay to the past inflation surge. That said, underlying inflation is overall developing in line with a sustained return of inflation to target.
The increase in compensation per employee moderated to 4.4 per cent in the third quarter from 4.7 per cent in the second. Amid stable productivity, this contributed to slower growth in unit labour costs. Staff expect labour costs to increase more slowly over the projection horizon as a result of lower wage growth and higher productivity growth. Moreover, profits should continue to partially offset the effects of higher labour costs on prices, especially in the near term.
We expect inflation to fluctuate around its current level in the near term, as previous sharp falls in energy prices continue to drop out of the annual rates. It should then settle sustainably at around the two per cent medium-term target. Easing labour cost pressures and the continuing impact of our past monetary policy tightening on consumer prices should help this process. Most measures of longer-term inflation expectations stand at around 2 per cent, and market-based indicators of medium to longer-term inflation compensation have decreased measurably since the Governing Council’s October meeting.
The risks to economic growth remain tilted to the downside. The risk of greater friction in global trade could weigh on euro area growth by dampening exports and weakening the global economy. Lower confidence could prevent consumption and investment from recovering as fast as expected. This could be amplified by geopolitical risks, such as Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine and the tragic conflict in the Middle East, which could disrupt energy supplies and global trade. Growth could also be lower if the lagged effects of monetary policy tightening last longer than expected. It could be higher if easier financing conditions and falling inflation allow domestic consumption and investment to rebound faster.
Inflation could turn out higher if wages or profits increase by more than expected. Upside risks to inflation also stem from the heightened geopolitical tensions, which could push energy prices and freight costs higher in the near term and disrupt global trade.Moreover, extreme weather events, and the unfolding climate crisis more broadly, could drive up food prices by more than expected. By contrast, inflation may surprise on the downside if low confidence and concerns about geopolitical events prevent consumption and investment from recovering as fast as expected, if monetary policy dampens demand more than expected, or if the economic environment in the rest of the world worsens unexpectedly. Greater friction in global trade would make the euro area inflation outlook more uncertain.
Market interest rates in the euro area have declined further since our October meeting, reflecting the perceived worsening of the economic outlook. Although financing conditions remain restrictive, our interest rate cuts are gradually makingit less expensive for firms and households to borrow.
The average interest rate on new loans to firms was 4.7 per cent in October, more than half a percentage point below its peak a year earlier. The cost of issuing market-based debt has fallen by more than a percentage point since its peak. The average rate on new mortgages, at 3.6 per cent in October, is about half a percentage point lower than at its highest point in 2023, even though the average rate on the outstanding stock of mortgages is still set to rise.
Bank lending to firms has gradually picked up from low levels, and increased by 1.2 per cent in October compared with a year earlier. Debt securities issued by firms were up 3.1% in annual terms, which was similar to the increase in the previous few months. Mortgage lending continued to rise gradually in October, with an annual growth rate of 0.8 per cent.
In line with our monetary policy strategy, the Governing Council thoroughly assessed the links between monetary policy and financial stability. Euro area banks remain resilient and there are few signs of financial market stress. Financial stability risks nonetheless remain elevated. Macroprudential policy remains the first line of defence against the build-up of financial vulnerabilities, enhancing resilience and preserving macroprudential space.
The Governing Council today decided to lower the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. In particular, the decision to lower the deposit facility rate – the rate through which we steer the monetary policy stance – is based on our updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. We are determined to ensure that inflation stabilises sustainably at our two per cent medium-term target. We will follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate monetary policy stance. In particular, our interest rate decisions will be based on our assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. We are not pre-committing to a particular rate path.
In any case, we stand ready to adjust all of our instruments within our mandate to ensure that inflation stabilises sustainably at our medium-term target and to preserve the smooth functioning of monetary policy transmission.
We are now ready to take your questions.
* * *
I have two questions. The first is on a general flavour of the arguments which have been exchanged in order to reach the decision today. What were the key arguments in favour of that 25 basis points rate cut? Second question, you dropped the reference to keep interest rates restrictive or sufficiently restrictive for the foreseeable future. Does that also mean that you consider perhaps a larger rate cut at your next policy meeting, or is that something you have been discussing, at least?
We had a Governing Council meeting that was the last of 2024 and which really led us to acknowledge, not yet the victory against inflation, not yet “mission accomplished”, but certainly it led us to acknowledge that inflation was really on track, in terms of reaching our 2% target in the medium-term. And that gave us a level of confidence to actually decide to cut and to decide the appropriate cut, which is, in our view, 25 basis points. That proposal was agreed by all members of the Governing Council. There were some discussions, with some proposals to consider possibly 50 basis points. But the overall agreement to which everybody rallied was that 25 basis points was actually the right decision. And I think it was predicated on three key elements. The first element is that inflation in our projections has converged towards 2% for six projection exercises in a row. So, you probably have forgotten, as I wish I had, the days when everybody was considering that maybe we would slip into 2026 and we would not reach 2% in 2025. Well, as I said, six times in a row, our projections are telling us that we will be at 2% target in the course of 2025 and if anything, it has moved a little bit forward in the course of 2025, but suffices to say that in 2025 we shall be at 2%. And that is, you know, clearly reflected in the projections that we have. I think the second element is that the fading of past shocks has pushed underlying inflation down. If I look, for instance, at wages, if I look at profits, and you remember the discussion that we had many times about the buffer that profits could exercise to absorb additional labour costs. We are actually seeing that reality unfolding and the projection for compensation, whether we look at the wage tracker, whether we look at compensation per employee, whether we look at the vacancy ratio, all of that is pointing in the direction of wages gradually, in the course of 2025 reaching a percentage increase that is compatible with our 2% target. And in terms of profits, we are also observing the same movement, of growth in profits having declined and being in a position to absorb some of this labour costs. Productivity: we are beginning to see also some a little bit more promising numbers. So those three components: wages, profit, productivity, also heading in the right direction. And I think the third element that we took into consideration, and that led us to this decision, is that risk to inflation is now two sided, clearly, and that led us to making the decision that we've made, but also removing the reference to restrictiveness that you have mentioned. And by that, I'm also addressing your second question by the same token. But having said all that, we still have service inflation, which is running high. And if we look in particular at domestic inflation, we are still at 4.2% and service inflation has hedged down a little bit from 4 to 3.9, but it is still resistant, and we would really want to see a change in the composition of inflation to feel totally confident that we are really almost at target.
Coming back to inflation, how do you see risks around inflation target? Do you feel the risk of undershooting is higher than the risk of overshooting? And could you give us a sense of those what those risks are?
You know, the risks to inflation are clearly stated in our monetary policy statement. And as I have said, they are more two sided than they were before, and that's really the analysis that we have about risk to inflation. That's how we look at it.
I'm wondering, when you when you changed that language on the need for restrictive policies, you must have had a debate about the neutral rate in one way or another. And I'm just wondering if you can fill us in a little bit on that debate and maybe share how far you think, and the Governing Council believes, current policy settings are from those neutral levels. And the second question I have is that, after what the market has heard so far, it is now pricing a larger 50 basis point cut for January, and I'm just wondering if you have any thoughts on that?
No, I don't really think about that, but I would simply observe that that was the case also a few weeks ago, and things change over the course of time, depending on data, depending on assessment of the situation, and this is exactly what we are going to do. We will continue to be data dependent. We will continue to decide meeting by meeting. We will continue to not have a pre-committed path downward, but it will be again based on the three criteria that we have flagged and that I have repeated at least three times in this monetary policy statement. I will not inflict a third repetition of that. That's what we will do, and we are not anticipating X or Y for the next monetary policy decision that that we will take. A lot is going to be clarified, we hope, in the next few months, not in the next few weeks. If there is one thing that we discussed in the last two days, it's the level of uncertainty that we are facing, and whether it's uncertainty resulting from political situations in some of the member states, whether it's uncertainty resulting from the outcome in terms of policies of the US elections, all of that is largely a question mark, because there is a distance between the words and the action taken. So, neutral rate. What I would really recommend is that you go back to this publication that we had approximately one year ago, which really discusses the tools and the methods that we all try to apply in order to determine something that cannot be determined with great precision, particularly in advance. And those methods are based on either the inflation, financing, savings, economies, and this is what is done by our staff, very ably. But have we discussed the neutral rate in the last couple of days? No.
What happens if the US set a tariff against Europe? Will the ECB react? And second question: inflation and core inflation in the medium term will settle at around 2%, so this is your mandate. Do you think it's time now to focus on improving the domestic demand and growth, that are both slow whereas the American economy is vigorous?
The first one about trade - I've given my views very extensively in a recent Financial Times interview, and I continue to think that restrictions on trade, protectionist measures, are not conducive to growth and ultimately have an impact on inflation that is largely uncertain. In the short term, it's probably net inflationary, probably, but the overall impact on inflation is uncertain, because it is going to depend on the scope of the measures, on the retaliation that is decided, on the rerouting of trade traffic from other parts of the world, and that is a very complex situation with movable parts, which we will determine if and when they come. On your second question, I'm tempted to suggest that you put it to somebody else, because our focus is price stability. That is our mandate, and that's the best we can do to help economic actors to make their decisions and to create growth and create value. Everybody has to do their job. We have to provide price stability. Member states in Europe and in the euro area in particular have to comply and respect  the fiscal governance framework that they have established for themselves, and that includes a combination of fiscal consolidation and growth-enhancing measures at the same time. And if other measures which are expected by the economic operators are delivered, then I don't see any reason why demand would not be stimulated as a result. But everybody has to do their job. The central bank cannot be the jack of all trades. We have to do our job, which is to procure price stability.
I have also a question on this dropped reference to keeping policy rates sufficiently restrictive. This was seen as a kind of sign of the tightening bias by many people, I think also within the ECB, that dropping this reference, does it mean you now have an easing bias? Or would that be pushing it too far? Would be interesting to get your thoughts on that. And my second question would be on the staff projections: I think in September, the minutes showed that when the projections were presented, there was already a concern that they might be too optimistic, because of all kind of things that had happened between the cutoff and the meeting. Has this been the case again, this time? And did you discuss how to respond to, in a scenario where those projections turned out to be too optimistic?
On your first question about restrictiveness, we are currently restrictive, and it's stated very clearly in the monetary policy statement, in the fourth paragraph, if I recall, where we say very clearly that - I want to give you the exact reference so that we don't make any mistake. It is in the fourth paragraph; we talk about the financing conditions and we say “but they continue to be tight because our monetary policy remains restrictive”. So, we are currently restrictive. There is no questioning in that respect. And the direction of travel currently is very clear. The pace at which it happens, the data that will determine it, the method that we will apply, the meeting by meeting, all of that is quite clear. But, you know, obviously, a lot of ground has been covered. We have already cut interest rates four times, a total of 100 basis points. We are now, as a result of this decision, today, at 3% for the DFR [Deposit facility rate], and we are in a completely different environment. We are getting much closer to target. As I said earlier, our projections for six times in a row indicate convergence towards 2% in 2025. We see two-sided risk to inflation. So, the macroeconomic landscape in which we make our decisions is vastly different from the days when we were at very high inflation, we had a lot of ground to cover, and risk to inflation was one sided. So as a result of that, it was completely legitimate and natural to remove that reference to being restrictive for long enough, to arrive at target in a timely manner. That is the other word which, as you may have noticed, has disappeared from our monetary policy statement, timely. Now you asked me a second question. You said, what about if staff projections are on the optimist side. First of all, I think that they do those projections in with a great sense of integrity and loyalty to the facts, to what is unquestionable, and they apply the best judgment that they can in the work that they do. So, I have no reason to doubt their projections. The element which has changed and which has been reinforced, as you will have noted also in the monetary policy statement, is the downside risk, particularly downside risk to growth, which is more elaborate in the wording of the monetary policy statement, and I think that that's a way to indicate that, given the uncertainty that we have in abundance, it is also the right approach to beef up the risk measurement.
My questions are on PEPP [Pandemic emergency purchasing programme] and on TPI [Transmission protection instrument]. Now, on PEPP, you will not have any more the flexibility of reinvesting the redemptions coming due at the PEPP portfolio, and you used it to counter risk to the monetary policy transmission mechanism. So, what do you think will be this impact of ending this reinvestment of PEPP, and you will only have now TPI, in a way, to intervene on the monetary policy mechanism. And at the moment, the spreads are not moving much, but I must say that the markets are surprised. For example, on the OAT-Bund spread given such a huge turbulence is not moving, and some traders are wondering whether you have been using TPI. But are we ever going to know if you use TPI? At least we knew you were using the PEPP reinvestments.
You are correct that PEPP is coming to the end of its active life, because we will stop any reinvestment as of the 17th of December. This will be the last reinvestment phase, and it has proven an incredibly efficient tool in order to fight the pandemic. It was also an extraordinary tool in that it was associated with flexibility, with no reference to the capital keys, if you remember, which was also quite a breakthrough and quite an exceptional tool for exceptional circumstances. I think the last time we used the flexibility was in July 2023[1]. It hasn't been used since that, at all. And yes, there was publication on a regular basis. And I think we will continue to have publications, I think on a monthly basis, actually, as opposed to the bi-monthly, which was every other month in the past, just to indicate what is the maturity of those bonds that are coming to maturity. We did not discuss TPI. And if you're interested in the conditions and the terms and the publication and the modalities, there's a great press release which is out there and which includes all of that.
You said that this greater confidence on the projections that we are seeing with these six [projections] in a row, targeting 2% in 2025, I was wondering if this greater confidence in the projections could lead to assume that even if we remain data dependent, it's correct to assume that the ECB is going to cut for the next meeting, unless this data dependency advised not to, because these projections have a market curve of interest rate that assume that. My other question is, given this already pretty low growth in forecast, if they incorporate this slowing growth rate that we have to expect from the US new administration or not, and if you like, have a say on that.
It's a general question you have on projections, really. So, the uncertainty that I referred to, stemming from the policies that could be decided by the next US administration, is not incorporated in the baseline. Except, I think from memory, the extension of the tax reductions that were, in a way, committed by both candidates to the presidency. I think that portion is included. It has a fiscal dimension to it, but the trade dimension is only incorporated indirectly, as you said, through using the yield curve and other market determined elements, which are only part of the many assumptions or data that are taken into consideration by staff when they do their projections. So, the trade uncertainty is captured in the Risk Assessment section, and we have taken the precaution to add a full sentence at the end of the risk paragraph to relate to the friction in relation to trade. And as I said to your colleague earlier on, it's a risk and of itself it's not good for growth at large. It produces uncertain inflation impact in the euro area, at least - I would not pass judgment on what it impacted would have on the on the US - but it's very tentative and it's very uncertain, and you really have to dig into it to appreciate what the impact will be. I think you should appreciate that we are on a path, currently, that leads us to reach our 2% target medium-term, and that our monetary policy stance, each and every step of the way, at each meeting will be determined by the data that we that we have, by the projection that is proposed by our staff, and will be based on those three criteria that you know well. So, to assume anything in particular at any point in time, I think, is not the right approach, because we are going to continue to be data dependent. We are not pre-committing to a particular path. We simply indicate by removing the reference to restrictiveness that we have come a long way. The situation is very different. We are much closer to a target which we are seeing much more closely now and as a result of that, we want to remain appropriate in our determination of monetary policy. If you want to compare apples and apples, it’s “restrictiveness” goes, “appropriate determination” replaces it, because we are getting closer, but we're not done. Let's face it, when you still have 4.2% domestic inflation and wages of which the growth is slowing down, you have to be very cautious.
Could you please elaborate on whether, as you put it, political instability in certain member states put the reaching of the goal at risk, and how the ECB can react to it?
I don't comment on any particular member states. I was simply referring, and I'll refer again in response to your question, to the uncertainty that is stemming from the lack of budget submission by several member states. If you ask me the list, I will be happy to procure it, but there are at least four of them that are either operating on the basis of an old budget from 2024 or 2023 or that simply do not have it yet. So, uncertainty about budget, which makes the fiscal projection a little bit complicated. Uncertainty about the actual political evolution, depending on elections, appointments or whatever, in several member states. That is self-inflicted uncertainty that we have nothing to do with, but which is caused by the current political situations. Things will, again, probably come to resolution, and we will see better the economic consequences of those decisions. Clearly, there are elections coming up in the first quarter of 2025 and hopefully decisions being made much earlier than that for other member states.
I know that you don't target exchange rates but inflation wise, would it be an extra concern if the euro goes below parity? And the second question, going back to the restrictiveness or not of the monetary policy, it seems that it remains restrictive, but I was wondering if you could point out if it is still very restrictive, or just slightly restrictive, because different members have stated different views in these terms.
You know, on your latter question, I’m off to Vilnius on Sunday night, and I will give a speech on those issues in particular, on Monday. So, I strongly encourage you to look at that speech. I know you do, so I feel very comfortable referring you to that. But it really dissects and in great detail this issue of how restrictive and the sort of the direction forward. On the exchange rate, you gave half the answer by saying that we do not target exchange rate, and I repeat that gladly, and obviously, exchange rate and variations have an impact on inflation, and we are attentive to that, and we will continue to be attentive to that in the next few weeks and months.
My question is not related to the monetary policy direction, but in Germany, a new snap election is planned to be held next February, and the right party, Alternative for Germany, so called AFD, plans to call to leave the EU and the euro currency. The argument is not new, but it seems the support for this party will be strong in this election, and as the ECB is present, who protects the euro system democracy? What can you say now?
Well, the European Union was founded by the founding member states, one of which was Germany, and it came on the step of a horrible period of time when member states, currently sitting at the same table were at each other's throat, and that caused the killing and the dying of many, many, many Europeans, and I would very much hope that this history, which is at the root of the construction, stays very clear on the mind of everyone.
I have one question, also concerning the neutral rate. There were very different views expressed by different members that there's a lot of room still, or no room at all? What's your view on that?
You know, I think this issue of the neutral rate is one that we will probably debate more and further, as we get closer to where it eventually is, and we will probably apply the various tools and methodologies that are suggested by staff in that work that was published about a year ago. I think the conventional wisdom around the table is that it is probably a little higher than where it was before, for multiple reasons, and that we will debate in due course. But it's premature to do that at the moment, and the numbers, if I recall, that were flagged by staff in that report, varied from 1.75 to 2.5 and you know, this is the range that is a result of the calculation and the methodologies that they have suggested. When we get there, I'm sure that we will be debating that.
Actually, it was summer 2022 (seepress release).

Press conference
Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB,
Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB
Good afternoon, the Vice-President and I welcome you to our press conference.
The Governing Council today decided to lower the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. In
particular, the decision to lower the deposit facility rate – the rate through which we steer the monetary
policy stance – is based on our updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of
underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission.
The disinflation process is well on track. Staff see headline inflation averaging 2.4 per cent in 2024,
2.1 per cent in 2025, 1.9 per cent in 2026 and 2.1 per cent in 2027 when the expanded EU Emissions
Trading System becomes operational. For inflation excluding energy and food, staff project an
average of 2.9 per cent in 2024, 2.3 per cent in 2025 and 1.9 per cent in both 2026 and 2027.
Most measures of underlying inflation suggest that inflation will settle at around our two per cent
medium-term target on a sustained basis. Domestic inflation has edged down but remains high, mostly
because wages and prices in certain sectors are still adjusting to the past inflation surge with a
substantial delay.
Financing conditions are easing, as our recent interest rate cuts gradually make new borrowing less
expensive for firms and households. But they continue to be tight because our monetary policy
remains restrictive and past interest rate hikes are still transmitting to the outstanding stock of credit.
Staff now expect a slower economic recovery than in the September projections. Although growth
picked up in the third quarter of this year, survey indicators suggest it has slowed in the current
quarter. Staff see the economy growing by 0.7 per cent in 2024, 1.1 per cent in 2025, 1.4 per cent in
2026 and 1.3 per cent in 2027. The projected recovery rests mainly on rising real incomes – which
should allow households to consume more – and firms increasing investment. Over time, the gradually
fading effects of restrictive monetary policy should support a pick-up in domestic demand.
We are determined to ensure that inflation stabilises sustainably at our two per cent medium-term
target. We will follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the
appropriate monetary policy stance. In particular, our interest rate decisions will be based on our
assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamicsof underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. We are not pre-committing to
a particular rate path.
The decisions taken today are set out in a press release available on our website.
I will now outline in more detail how we see the economy and inflation developing and will then explain
our assessment of financial and monetary conditions.
Economic activity
The economy grew by 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, exceeding expectations. Growth was driven
mainly by an increase in consumption, partly reflecting one-off factors that boosted tourism over the
summer, and by firms building up inventories. But the latest information suggests it is losing
momentum. Surveys indicate that manufacturing is still contracting and growth in services is slowing.
Firms are holding back their investment spending in the face of weak demand and a highly uncertain
outlook. Exports are also weak, with some European industries finding it challenging to remain
competitive.
The labour market remains resilient. Employment grew by 0.2 per cent in the third quarter, again by
more than expected. The unemployment rate remained at its historical low of 6.3 per cent in October.
Meanwhile, demand for labour continues to weaken. The job vacancy rate declined to 2.5% in the third
quarter, 0.8 percentage points below its peak, and surveys also point to fewer jobs being created in
the current quarter.
The economy should strengthen over time, although more slowly than previously expected. The rise in
real wages should strengthen household spending. More affordable credit should boost consumption
and investment. Provided trade tensions do not escalate, exports should support the recovery as
global demand rises.
Fiscal and structural policies should make the economy more productive, competitive and resilient. It is
crucial to swiftly follow up, with concrete and ambitious structural policies, on Mario Draghi’s proposals
for enhancing European competitiveness and Enrico Letta’s proposals for empowering the Single
Market. We welcome the European Commission’s assessment of governments’ medium-term plans
for fiscal and structural policies, as part of the EU’s revised economic governance framework.
Governments should now focus on implementing their commitments under this framework fully and
without delay. This will help bring down budget deficits and debt ratios on a sustained basis, while
prioritising growth-enhancing reforms and investment.Inflation
Annual inflation increased to 2.3 per cent in November according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, from 2.0
per cent in October. The increase was expected and primarily reflected an energy-related upward
base effect. Food price inflation edged down to 2.8 per cent and services inflation to 3.9 per cent.
Goods inflation went up to 0.7 per cent.
Domestic inflation, which closely tracks services inflation, again eased somewhat in October. But at
4.2%, it remains high. This reflects strong wage pressures and the fact that some services prices are
still adjusting with a delay to the past inflation surge. That said, underlying inflation is overall
developing in line with a sustained return of inflation to target.
The increase in compensation per employee moderated to 4.4 per cent in the third quarter from 4.7
per cent in the second. Amid stable productivity, this contributed to slower growth in unit labour costs.
Staff expect labour costs to increase more slowly over the projection horizon as a result of lower wage
growth and higher productivity growth. Moreover, profits should continue to partially offset the effects
of higher labour costs on prices, especially in the near term.
We expect inflation to fluctuate around its current level in the near term, as previous sharp falls in
energy prices continue to drop out of the annual rates. It should then settle sustainably at around the
two per cent medium-term target. Easing labour cost pressures and the continuing impact of our past
monetary policy tightening on consumer prices should help this process. Most measures of longer-
term inflation expectations stand at around 2 per cent, and market-based indicators of medium to
longer-term inflation compensation have decreased measurably since the Governing Council’s
October meeting.
Risk assessment
The risks to economic growth remain tilted to the downside. The risk of greater friction in global trade
could weigh on euro area growth by dampening exports and weakening the global economy. Lower
confidence could prevent consumption and investment from recovering as fast as expected. This
could be amplified by geopolitical risks, such as Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine and the tragic
conflict in the Middle East, which could disrupt energy supplies and global trade. Growth could also be
lower if the lagged effects of monetary policy tightening last longer than expected. It could be higher if
easier financing conditions and falling inflation allow domestic consumption and investment to rebound
faster.
Inflation could turn out higher if wages or profits increase by more than expected. Upside risks to
inflation also stem from the heightened geopolitical tensions, which could push energy prices andfreight costs higher in the near term and disrupt global trade. Moreover, extreme weather events, and
the unfolding climate crisis more broadly, could drive up food prices by more than expected. By
contrast, inflation may surprise on the downside if low confidence and concerns about geopolitical
events prevent consumption and investment from recovering as fast as expected, if monetary policy
dampens demand more than expected, or if the economic environment in the rest of the world
worsens unexpectedly. Greater friction in global trade would make the euro area inflation outlook more
uncertain.
Financial and monetary conditions
Market interest rates in the euro area have declined further since our October meeting, reflecting the
perceived worsening of the economic outlook. Although financing conditions remain restrictive, our
interest rate cuts are gradually making it less expensive for firms and households to borrow.
The average interest rate on new loans to firms was 4.7 per cent in October, more than half a
percentage point below its peak a year earlier. The cost of issuing market-based debt has fallen by
more than a percentage point since its peak. The average rate on new mortgages, at 3.6 per cent in
October, is about half a percentage point lower than at its highest point in 2023, even though the
average rate on the outstanding stock of mortgages is still set to rise.
Bank lending to firms has gradually picked up from low levels, and increased by 1.2 per cent in
October compared with a year earlier. Debt securities issued by firms were up 3.1% in annual terms,
which was similar to the increase in the previous few months. Mortgage lending continued to rise
gradually in October, with an annual growth rate of 0.8 per cent.
In line with our monetary policy strategy, the Governing Council thoroughly assessed the links
between monetary policy and financial stability. Euro area banks remain resilient and there are few
signs of financial market stress. Financial stability risks nonetheless remain elevated. Macroprudential
policy remains the first line of defence against the build-up of financial vulnerabilities, enhancing
resilience and preserving macroprudential space.
Conclusion
The Governing Council today decided to lower the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. In
particular, the decision to lower the deposit facility rate – the rate through which we steer the monetary
policy stance – is based on our updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of
underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. We are determined to ensurethat inflation stabilises sustainably at our two per cent medium-term target. We will follow a data-
dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate monetary policy stance.
In particular, our interest rate decisions will be based on our assessment of the inflation outlook in light
of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of
monetary policy transmission. We are not pre-committing to a particular rate path.
In any case, we stand ready to adjust all of our instruments within our mandate to ensure that inflation
stabilises sustainably at our medium-term target and to preserve the smooth functioning of monetary
policy transmission.
We are now ready to take your questions."

remains restrictive and past interest rate hikes are still transmitting to the outstanding stock of credit.
Staff now expect a slower economic recovery than in the September projections. Although growth
picked up in the third quarter of this year, survey indicators suggest it has slowed in the current
quarter. Staff see the economy growing by 0.7 per cent in 2024, 1.1 per cent in 2025, 1.4 per cent in
2026 and 1.3 per cent in 2027. The projected recovery rests mainly on rising real incomes – which
should allow households to consume more – and firms increasing investment. Over time, the gradually
fading effects of restrictive monetary policy should support a pick-up in domestic demand.
We are determined to ensure that inflation stabilises sustainably at our two per cent medium-term
target. We will follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the
appropriate monetary policy stance. In particular, our interest rate decisions will be based on our
assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamicsof underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. We are not pre-committing to
a particular rate path.
The decisions taken today are set out in a press release available on our website.
I will now outline in more detail how we see the economy and inflation developing and will then explain
our assessment of financial and monetary conditions.
Economic activity
The economy grew by 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, exceeding expectations. Growth was driven
mainly by an increase in consumption, partly reflecting one-off factors that boosted tourism over the
summer, and by firms building up inventories. But the latest information suggests it is losing
momentum. Surveys indicate that manufacturing is still contracting and growth in services is slowing.
Firms are holding back their investment spending in the face of weak demand and a highly uncertain
outlook. Exports are also weak, with some European industries finding it challenging to remain
competitive.
The labour market remains resilient. Employment grew by 0.2 per cent in the third quarter, again by
more than expected. The unemployment rate remained at its historical low of 6.3 per cent in October.
Meanwhile, demand for labour continues to weaken. The job vacancy rate declined to 2.5% in the third
quarter, 0.8 percentage points below its peak, and surveys also point to fewer jobs being created in
the current quarter.
The economy should strengthen over time, although more slowly than previously expected. The rise in
real wages should strengthen household spending. More affordable credit should boost consumption
and investment. Provided trade tensions do not escalate, exports should support the recovery as
global demand rises.
Fiscal and structural policies should make the economy more productive, competitive and resilient. It is
crucial to swiftly follow up, with concrete and ambitious structural policies, on Mario Draghi’s proposals
for enhancing European competitiveness and Enrico Letta’s proposals for empowering the Single
Market. We welcome the European Commission’s assessment of governments’ medium-term plans
for fiscal and structural policies, as part of the EU’s revised economic governance framework.
Governments should now focus on implementing their commitments under this framework fully and
without delay. This will help bring down budget deficits and debt ratios on a sustained basis, while
prioritising growth-enhancing reforms and investment.Inflation
Annual inflation increased to 2.3 per cent in November according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, from 2.0
per cent in October. The increase was expected and primarily reflected an energy-related upward
base effect. Food price inflation edged down to 2.8 per cent and services inflation to 3.9 per cent.
Goods inflation went up to 0.7 per cent.
Domestic inflation, which closely tracks services inflation, again eased somewhat in October. But at
4.2%, it remains high. This reflects strong wage pressures and the fact that some services prices are
still adjusting with a delay to the past inflation surge. That said, underlying inflation is overall
developing in line with a sustained return of inflation to target.
The increase in compensation per employee moderated to 4.4 per cent in the third quarter from 4.7
per cent in the second. Amid stable productivity, this contributed to slower growth in unit labour costs.
Staff expect labour costs to increase more slowly over the projection horizon as a result of lower wage
growth and higher productivity growth. Moreover, profits should continue to partially offset the effects
of higher labour costs on prices, especially in the near term.
We expect inflation to fluctuate around its current level in the near term, as previous sharp falls in
energy prices continue to drop out of the annual rates. It should then settle sustainably at around the
two per cent medium-term target. Easing labour cost pressures and the continuing impact of our past
monetary policy tightening on consumer prices should help this process. Most measures of longer-
term inflation expectations stand at around 2 per cent, and market-based indicators of medium to
longer-term inflation compensation have decreased measurably since the Governing Council’s
October meeting.
Risk assessment
The risks to economic growth remain tilted to the downside. The risk of greater friction in global trade
could weigh on euro area growth by dampening exports and weakening the global economy. Lower
confidence could prevent consumption and investment from recovering as fast as expected. This
could be amplified by geopolitical risks, such as Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine and the tragic
conflict in the Middle East, which could disrupt energy supplies and global trade. Growth could also be
lower if the lagged effects of monetary policy tightening last longer than expected. It could be higher if
easier financing conditions and falling inflation allow domestic consumption and investment to rebound
faster.
Inflation could turn out higher if wages or profits increase by more than expected. Upside risks to
inflation also stem from the heightened geopolitical tensions, which could push energy prices andfreight costs higher in the near term and disrupt global trade. Moreover, extreme weather events, and
the unfolding climate crisis more broadly, could drive up food prices by more than expected. By
contrast, inflation may surprise on the downside if low confidence and concerns about geopolitical
events prevent consumption and investment from recovering as fast as expected, if monetary policy
dampens demand more than expected, or if the economic environment in the rest of the world
worsens unexpectedly. Greater friction in global trade would make the euro area inflation outlook more
uncertain.
Financial and monetary conditions
Market interest rates in the euro area have declined further since our October meeting, reflecting the
perceived worsening of the economic outlook. Although financing conditions remain restrictive, our
interest rate cuts are gradually making it less expensive for firms and households to borrow.
The average interest rate on new loans to firms was 4.7 per cent in October, more than half a
percentage point below its peak a year earlier. The cost of issuing market-based debt has fallen by
more than a percentage point since its peak. The average rate on new mortgages, at 3.6 per cent in
October, is about half a percentage point lower than at its highest point in 2023, even though the
average rate on the outstanding stock of mortgages is still set to rise.
Bank lending to firms has gradually picked up from low levels, and increased by 1.2 per cent in
October compared with a year earlier. Debt securities issued by firms were up 3.1% in annual terms,
which was similar to the increase in the previous few months. Mortgage lending continued to rise
gradually in October, with an annual growth rate of 0.8 per cent.
In line with our monetary policy strategy, the Governing Council thoroughly assessed the links
between monetary policy and financial stability. Euro area banks remain resilient and there are few
signs of financial market stress. Financial stability risks nonetheless remain elevated. Macroprudential
policy remains the first line of defence against the build-up of financial vulnerabilities, enhancing
resilience and preserving macroprudential space.
Conclusion
The Governing Council today decided to lower the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. In
particular, the decision to lower the deposit facility rate – the rate through which we steer the monetary
policy stance – is based on our updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of
underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. We are determined to ensurethat inflation stabilises sustainably at our two per cent medium-term target. We will follow a data-
dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate monetary policy stance.
In particular, our interest rate decisions will be based on our assessment of the inflation outlook in light
of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of
monetary policy transmission. We are not pre-committing to a particular rate path.
In any case, we stand ready to adjust all of our instruments within our mandate to ensure that inflation
stabilises sustainably at our medium-term target and to preserve the smooth functioning of monetary
policy transmission.
We are now ready to take your questions."

Good afternoon, the Vice-President and I welcome you to our press conference.
The Governing Council today decided to lower the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points.In particular, the decision to lower the deposit facility rate – the rate through which we steer the monetary policy stance – is based on our updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission.
The disinflation process is well on track. Staff see headline inflation averaging 2.4 per cent in 2024, 2.1 per cent in 2025, 1.9 per cent in 2026 and 2.1 per cent in 2027 when the expanded EU Emissions Trading System becomes operational. For inflation excluding energy and food, staff project an average of 2.9 per cent in 2024, 2.3 per cent in 2025 and 1.9 per cent in both 2026 and 2027.
Most measures of underlying inflation suggest that inflation will settle at around our two per cent medium-term target on a sustained basis. Domestic inflation has edged down but remains high, mostly because wages and prices in certain sectors are still adjusting to the past inflation surge with a substantial delay.
Financing conditions are easing, as our recent interest rate cuts gradually make new borrowing less expensive for firms and households.But they continue to be tight because our monetary policy remains restrictive and past interest rate hikes are still transmitting to the outstanding stock of credit.
Staff now expect a slower economic recovery than in the September projections. Although growth picked up in the third quarter of this year, survey indicators suggest it has slowed in the current quarter. Staff see the economy growing by 0.7 per cent in 2024, 1.1 per cent in 2025, 1.4 per cent in 2026 and 1.3 per cent in 2027. The projected recovery rests mainly on rising real incomes – which should allow households to consume more – and firms increasing investment. Over time, the gradually fading effects of restrictive monetary policy should support a pick-up in domestic demand.
We are determined to ensure that inflation stabilises sustainably at our two per cent medium-term target.

I will now outline in more detail how we see the economy and inflation developing and will then explain our assessment of financial and monetary conditions.
The economy grew by 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, exceeding expectations. Growth was driven mainly by an increase in consumption, partly reflecting one-off factors that boosted tourism over the summer, and by firms building up inventories.

Amid stable productivity, this contributed to slower growth in unit labour costs. Staff expect labour costs to increase more slowly over the projection horizon as a result of lower wage growth and higher productivity growth. Moreover, profits should continue to partially offset the effects of higher labour costs on prices, especially in the near term.
We expect inflation to fluctuate around its current level in the near term, as previous sharp falls in energy prices continue to drop out of the annual rates. It should then settle sustainably at around the two per cent medium-term target. Easing labour cost pressures and the continuing impact of our past monetary policy tightening on consumer prices should help this process. Most measures of longer-term inflation expectations stand at around 2 per cent, and market-based indicators of medium to longer-term inflation compensation have decreased measurably since the Governing Council’s October meeting.
The risks to economic growth remain tilted to the downside. The risk of greater friction in global trade could weigh on euro area growth by dampening exports and weakening the global economy. Lower confidence could prevent consumption and investment from recovering as fast as expected.

By contrast, inflation may surprise on the downside if low confidence and concerns about geopolitical events prevent consumption and investment from recovering as fast as expected, if monetary policy dampens demand more than expected, or if the economic environment in the rest of the world worsens unexpectedly. Greater friction in global trade would make the euro area inflation outlook more uncertain.
Market interest rates in the euro area have declined further since our October meeting, reflecting the perceived worsening of the economic outlook. Although financing conditions remain restrictive, our interest rate cuts are gradually makingit less expensive for firms and households to borrow.
The average interest rate on new loans to firms was 4.7 per cent in October, more than half a percentage point below its peak a year earlier.

The average rate on new mortgages, at 3.6 per cent in October, is about half a percentage point lower than at its highest point in 2023, even though the average rate on the outstanding stock of mortgages is still set to rise.

In line with our monetary policy strategy, the Governing Council thoroughly assessed the links between monetary policy and financial stability.

Macroprudential policy remains the first line of defence against the build-up of financial vulnerabilities, enhancing resilience and preserving macroprudential space.

In any case, we stand ready to adjust all of our instruments within our mandate to ensure that inflation stabilises sustainably at our medium-term target and to preserve the smooth functioning of monetary policy transmission.
We are now ready to take your questions.
* * *
I have two questions. The first is on a general flavour of the arguments which have been exchanged in order to reach the decision today. What were the key arguments in favour of that 25 basis points rate cut? Second question, you dropped the reference to keep interest rates restrictive or sufficiently restrictive for the foreseeable future. Does that also mean that you consider perhaps a larger rate cut at your next policy meeting, or is that something you have been discussing, at least?
We had a Governing Council meeting that was the last of 2024 and which really led us to acknowledge, not yet the victory against inflation, not yet “mission accomplished”, but certainly it led us to acknowledge that inflation was really on track, in terms of reaching our 2% target in the medium-term. And that gave us a level of confidence to actually decide to cut and to decide the appropriate cut, which is, in our view, 25 basis points. That proposal was agreed by all members of the Governing Council. There were some discussions, with some proposals to consider possibly 50 basis points. But the overall agreement to which everybody rallied was that 25 basis points was actually the right decision. And I think it was predicated on three key elements. The first element is that inflation in our projections has converged towards 2% for six projection exercises in a row. So, you probably have forgotten, as I wish I had, the days when everybody was considering that maybe we would slip into 2026 and we would not reach 2% in 2025. Well, as I said, six times in a row, our projections are telling us that we will be at 2% target in the course of 2025 and if anything, it has moved a little bit forward in the course of 2025, but suffices to say that in 2025 we shall be at 2%. And that is, you know, clearly reflected in the projections that we have. I think the second element is that the fading of past shocks has pushed underlying inflation down. If I look, for instance, at wages, if I look at profits, and you remember the discussion that we had many times about the buffer that profits could exercise to absorb additional labour costs. We are actually seeing that reality unfolding and the projection for compensation, whether we look at the wage tracker, whether we look at compensation per employee, whether we look at the vacancy ratio, all of that is pointing in the direction of wages gradually, in the course of 2025 reaching a percentage increase that is compatible with our 2% target. And in terms of profits, we are also observing the same movement, of growth in profits having declined and being in a position to absorb some of this labour costs. Productivity: we are beginning to see also some a little bit more promising numbers. So those three components: wages, profit, productivity, also heading in the right direction. And I think the third element that we took into consideration, and that led us to this decision, is that risk to inflation is now two sided, clearly, and that led us to making the decision that we've made, but also removing the reference to restrictiveness that you have mentioned. And by that, I'm also addressing your second question by the same token. But having said all that, we still have service inflation, which is running high. And if we look in particular at domestic inflation, we are still at 4.2% and service inflation has hedged down a little bit from 4 to 3.9, but it is still resistant, and we would really want to see a change in the composition of inflation to feel totally confident that we are really almost at target.
Coming back to inflation, how do you see risks around inflation target? Do you feel the risk of undershooting is higher than the risk of overshooting? And could you give us a sense of those what those risks are?
You know, the risks to inflation are clearly stated in our monetary policy statement. And as I have said, they are more two sided than they were before, and that's really the analysis that we have about risk to inflation. That's how we look at it.
I'm wondering, when you when you changed that language on the need for restrictive policies, you must have had a debate about the neutral rate in one way or another. And I'm just wondering if you can fill us in a little bit on that debate and maybe share how far you think, and the Governing Council believes, current policy settings are from those neutral levels. And the second question I have is that, after what the market has heard so far, it is now pricing a larger 50 basis point cut for January, and I'm just wondering if you have any thoughts on that?
No, I don't really think about that, but I would simply observe that that was the case also a few weeks ago, and things change over the course of time, depending on data, depending on assessment of the situation, and this is exactly what we are going to do. We will continue to be data dependent. We will continue to decide meeting by meeting. We will continue to not have a pre-committed path downward, but it will be again based on the three criteria that we have flagged and that I have repeated at least three times in this monetary policy statement. I will not inflict a third repetition of that. That's what we will do, and we are not anticipating X or Y for the next monetary policy decision that that we will take. A lot is going to be clarified, we hope, in the next few months, not in the next few weeks. If there is one thing that we discussed in the last two days, it's the level of uncertainty that we are facing, and whether it's uncertainty resulting from political situations in some of the member states, whether it's uncertainty resulting from the outcome in terms of policies of the US elections, all of that is largely a question mark, because there is a distance between the words and the action taken. So, neutral rate. What I would really recommend is that you go back to this publication that we had approximately one year ago, which really discusses the tools and the methods that we all try to apply in order to determine something that cannot be determined with great precision, particularly in advance. And those methods are based on either the inflation, financing, savings, economies, and this is what is done by our staff, very ably. But have we discussed the neutral rate in the last couple of days? No.
What happens if the US set a tariff against Europe? Will the ECB react? And second question: inflation and core inflation in the medium term will settle at around 2%, so this is your mandate. Do you think it's time now to focus on improving the domestic demand and growth, that are both slow whereas the American economy is vigorous?
The first one about trade - I've given my views very extensively in a recent Financial Times interview, and I continue to think that restrictions on trade, protectionist measures, are not conducive to growth and ultimately have an impact on inflation that is largely uncertain. In the short term, it's probably net inflationary, probably, but the overall impact on inflation is uncertain, because it is going to depend on the scope of the measures, on the retaliation that is decided, on the rerouting of trade traffic from other parts of the world, and that is a very complex situation with movable parts, which we will determine if and when they come. On your second question, I'm tempted to suggest that you put it to somebody else, because our focus is price stability. That is our mandate, and that's the best we can do to help economic actors to make their decisions and to create growth and create value. Everybody has to do their job. We have to provide price stability. Member states in Europe and in the euro area in particular have to comply and respect  the fiscal governance framework that they have established for themselves, and that includes a combination of fiscal consolidation and growth-enhancing measures at the same time. And if other measures which are expected by the economic operators are delivered, then I don't see any reason why demand would not be stimulated as a result. But everybody has to do their job. The central bank cannot be the jack of all trades. We have to do our job, which is to procure price stability.
I have also a question on this dropped reference to keeping policy rates sufficiently restrictive. This was seen as a kind of sign of the tightening bias by many people, I think also within the ECB, that dropping this reference, does it mean you now have an easing bias? Or would that be pushing it too far? Would be interesting to get your thoughts on that. And my second question would be on the staff projections: I think in September, the minutes showed that when the projections were presented, there was already a concern that they might be too optimistic, because of all kind of things that had happened between the cutoff and the meeting. Has this been the case again, this time? And did you discuss how to respond to, in a scenario where those projections turned out to be too optimistic?
On your first question about restrictiveness, we are currently restrictive, and it's stated very clearly in the monetary policy statement, in the fourth paragraph, if I recall, where we say very clearly that - I want to give you the exact reference so that we don't make any mistake. It is in the fourth paragraph; we talk about the financing conditions and we say “but they continue to be tight because our monetary policy remains restrictive”. So, we are currently restrictive. There is no questioning in that respect. And the direction of travel currently is very clear. The pace at which it happens, the data that will determine it, the method that we will apply, the meeting by meeting, all of that is quite clear. But, you know, obviously, a lot of ground has been covered. We have already cut interest rates four times, a total of 100 basis points. We are now, as a result of this decision, today, at 3% for the DFR [Deposit facility rate], and we are in a completely different environment. We are getting much closer to target. As I said earlier, our projections for six times in a row indicate convergence towards 2% in 2025. We see two-sided risk to inflation. So, the macroeconomic landscape in which we make our decisions is vastly different from the days when we were at very high inflation, we had a lot of ground to cover, and risk to inflation was one sided. So as a result of that, it was completely legitimate and natural to remove that reference to being restrictive for long enough, to arrive at target in a timely manner. That is the other word which, as you may have noticed, has disappeared from our monetary policy statement, timely. Now you asked me a second question. You said, what about if staff projections are on the optimist side. First of all, I think that they do those projections in with a great sense of integrity and loyalty to the facts, to what is unquestionable, and they apply the best judgment that they can in the work that they do. So, I have no reason to doubt their projections. The element which has changed and which has been reinforced, as you will have noted also in the monetary policy statement, is the downside risk, particularly downside risk to growth, which is more elaborate in the wording of the monetary policy statement, and I think that that's a way to indicate that, given the uncertainty that we have in abundance, it is also the right approach to beef up the risk measurement.
My questions are on PEPP [Pandemic emergency purchasing programme] and on TPI [Transmission protection instrument]. Now, on PEPP, you will not have any more the flexibility of reinvesting the redemptions coming due at the PEPP portfolio, and you used it to counter risk to the monetary policy transmission mechanism. So, what do you think will be this impact of ending this reinvestment of PEPP, and you will only have now TPI, in a way, to intervene on the monetary policy mechanism. And at the moment, the spreads are not moving much, but I must say that the markets are surprised. For example, on the OAT-Bund spread given such a huge turbulence is not moving, and some traders are wondering whether you have been using TPI. But are we ever going to know if you use TPI? At least we knew you were using the PEPP reinvestments.
You are correct that PEPP is coming to the end of its active life, because we will stop any reinvestment as of the 17th of December. This will be the last reinvestment phase, and it has proven an incredibly efficient tool in order to fight the pandemic. It was also an extraordinary tool in that it was associated with flexibility, with no reference to the capital keys, if you remember, which was also quite a breakthrough and quite an exceptional tool for exceptional circumstances. I think the last time we used the flexibility was in July 2023[1]. It hasn't been used since that, at all. And yes, there was publication on a regular basis. And I think we will continue to have publications, I think on a monthly basis, actually, as opposed to the bi-monthly, which was every other month in the past, just to indicate what is the maturity of those bonds that are coming to maturity. We did not discuss TPI. And if you're interested in the conditions and the terms and the publication and the modalities, there's a great press release which is out there and which includes all of that.
You said that this greater confidence on the projections that we are seeing with these six [projections] in a row, targeting 2% in 2025, I was wondering if this greater confidence in the projections could lead to assume that even if we remain data dependent, it's correct to assume that the ECB is going to cut for the next meeting, unless this data dependency advised not to, because these projections have a market curve of interest rate that assume that. My other question is, given this already pretty low growth in forecast, if they incorporate this slowing growth rate that we have to expect from the US new administration or not, and if you like, have a say on that.
It's a general question you have on projections, really. So, the uncertainty that I referred to, stemming from the policies that could be decided by the next US administration, is not incorporated in the baseline. Except, I think from memory, the extension of the tax reductions that were, in a way, committed by both candidates to the presidency. I think that portion is included. It has a fiscal dimension to it, but the trade dimension is only incorporated indirectly, as you said, through using the yield curve and other market determined elements, which are only part of the many assumptions or data that are taken into consideration by staff when they do their projections. So, the trade uncertainty is captured in the Risk Assessment section, and we have taken the precaution to add a full sentence at the end of the risk paragraph to relate to the friction in relation to trade. And as I said to your colleague earlier on, it's a risk and of itself it's not good for growth at large. It produces uncertain inflation impact in the euro area, at least - I would not pass judgment on what it impacted would have on the on the US - but it's very tentative and it's very uncertain, and you really have to dig into it to appreciate what the impact will be. I think you should appreciate that we are on a path, currently, that leads us to reach our 2% target medium-term, and that our monetary policy stance, each and every step of the way, at each meeting will be determined by the data that we that we have, by the projection that is proposed by our staff, and will be based on those three criteria that you know well. So, to assume anything in particular at any point in time, I think, is not the right approach, because we are going to continue to be data dependent. We are not pre-committing to a particular path. We simply indicate by removing the reference to restrictiveness that we have come a long way. The situation is very different. We are much closer to a target which we are seeing much more closely now and as a result of that, we want to remain appropriate in our determination of monetary policy. If you want to compare apples and apples, it’s “restrictiveness” goes, “appropriate determination” replaces it, because we are getting closer, but we're not done. Let's face it, when you still have 4.2% domestic inflation and wages of which the growth is slowing down, you have to be very cautious.
Could you please elaborate on whether, as you put it, political instability in certain member states put the reaching of the goal at risk, and how the ECB can react to it?
I don't comment on any particular member states. I was simply referring, and I'll refer again in response to your question, to the uncertainty that is stemming from the lack of budget submission by several member states. If you ask me the list, I will be happy to procure it, but there are at least four of them that are either operating on the basis of an old budget from 2024 or 2023 or that simply do not have it yet. So, uncertainty about budget, which makes the fiscal projection a little bit complicated. Uncertainty about the actual political evolution, depending on elections, appointments or whatever, in several member states. That is self-inflicted uncertainty that we have nothing to do with, but which is caused by the current political situations. Things will, again, probably come to resolution, and we will see better the economic consequences of those decisions. Clearly, there are elections coming up in the first quarter of 2025 and hopefully decisions being made much earlier than that for other member states.
I know that you don't target exchange rates but inflation wise, would it be an extra concern if the euro goes below parity? And the second question, going back to the restrictiveness or not of the monetary policy, it seems that it remains restrictive, but I was wondering if you could point out if it is still very restrictive, or just slightly restrictive, because different members have stated different views in these terms.
You know, on your latter question, I’m off to Vilnius on Sunday night, and I will give a speech on those issues in particular, on Monday. So, I strongly encourage you to look at that speech. I know you do, so I feel very comfortable referring you to that. But it really dissects and in great detail this issue of how restrictive and the sort of the direction forward. On the exchange rate, you gave half the answer by saying that we do not target exchange rate, and I repeat that gladly, and obviously, exchange rate and variations have an impact on inflation, and we are attentive to that, and we will continue to be attentive to that in the next few weeks and months.
My question is not related to the monetary policy direction, but in Germany, a new snap election is planned to be held next February, and the right party, Alternative for Germany, so called AFD, plans to call to leave the EU and the euro currency. The argument is not new, but it seems the support for this party will be strong in this election, and as the ECB is present, who protects the euro system democracy? What can you say now?
Well, the European Union was founded by the founding member states, one of which was Germany, and it came on the step of a horrible period of time when member states, currently sitting at the same table were at each other's throat, and that caused the killing and the dying of many, many, many Europeans, and I would very much hope that this history, which is at the root of the construction, stays very clear on the mind of everyone.
I have one question, also concerning the neutral rate. There were very different views expressed by different members that there's a lot of room still, or no room at all? What's your view on that?
You know, I think this issue of the neutral rate is one that we will probably debate more and further, as we get closer to where it eventually is, and we will probably apply the various tools and methodologies that are suggested by staff in that work that was published about a year ago. I think the conventional wisdom around the table is that it is probably a little higher than where it was before, for multiple reasons, and that we will debate in due course. But it's premature to do that at the moment, and the numbers, if I recall, that were flagged by staff in that report, varied from 1.75 to 2.5 and you know, this is the range that is a result of the calculation and the methodologies that they have suggested. When we get there, I'm sure that we will be debating that.
Actually, it was summer 2022 (seepress release).

en,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/ecb_statistics/reporting/IReF/html/index.en.html,4 December 2024,"The Integrated Reporting Framework (IReF) will integrate the Eurosystem’s statistical requirements for banks. It will be applicable across the euro area and may also be adopted by authorities in other EU Member States.
The IReF focuses mainly on the requirements of the European Central Bank (ECB) in terms of banks’ balance sheet and interest rate statistics, securities holdings statistics and granular credit data. Data collection and transformation processes will also be standardised across countries. To maximise the benefits of integration, any relevant reporting obligations from national collection frameworks used by national central banks (NCBs) will also be taken into account. In its initial stage, the IReF will focus on ECB statistical frameworks that directly relate to banks’ balance sheet assets and liabilities but will at the same time also represent a first tangible step towards the integration of statistical and prudential reporting in Europe. It will not, however, cover ECB requirements relating to payments or money market statistics. The IReF is also designed to ensure proportionality by limiting the reporting obligations for small banks.
IReF reporting is currently planned to start in the fourth quarter of 2029, as communicated in apress releasein December 2024.
Integrating existing statistical requirements into the IReF will help banks by standardising reporting obligations, reducing redundancies and overlaps, minimising the reporting burden and enhancing data quality. The IReF will also help automate data processing while minimising the cost of any further changes to the data collected. The framework will particularly benefit banks operating in multiple countries, as the integrated requirements will enable consistent and standardised reporting across borders. Statistical compilers and other users will also benefit, as integration will make it easier to compare data across countries, as well as improving data quality and data collection. In addition, it will help enable agile policymaking and analysis by reducing time to market.
In November 2020 the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) launched a cost-benefit assessment to evaluate the impact of the IReF in collaboration with the banking industry. All euro area countries, along with Sweden, participated in the exercise. The assessment was completed in April 2021 and confirmed strong support for the IReF within the banking industry and among stakeholders, with a large majority of banks confirming that the reduction in reporting costs would more than make up for the investment required. The ECB published a high-level report in December 2021 before further releasing three, more detailed reports in September 2022.
The ESCB, together with all other stakeholders,launched a complementary cost-benefit assessment(complementary CBA) in May 2023, aimed at clarifying additional topics relating to the IReF. The first report on the complementary CBA was published in February 2024. It assesses the extent to which country-specific statistical reporting requirements could be usefully included in the IReF Regulation.
Two further reports, one focusing on enhancing the IReF analytical value and on operational aspects and the other focusing on closer alignment between the IReF and FINREP solo, were published in April 2024, presenting the results of the analysis of the remaining complementary CBA topics.
The Eurosystem is currently drafting an ECB Regulation on the IReF. The draft IReF Regulation will be subject to a public consultation before it is finalised and adopted. Existing ECB regulations containing statistical requirements that will be included in the IReF Regulation will be repealed or amended.

The Eurosystem’s digital euro project aims to make central bank money available to the public in digital form.As e-commerce evolves and people increasingly prefer to make payments using electronic means, a digital euro would bring the valued features of banknotes into the digital sphere.The aim of a digital euro is to bring value to consumers, merchants and intermediaries, while reducing Europe’s dependence on international card schemes and non-European digital payment wallet providers. A digital euro would complement cash by providing a digital payment option for consumers that is free, safe and easy to use. It would facilitate electronic payments everywhere in the euro area and increase competitiveness in the payments market for merchants.Payment service providers (PSPs) would be able to use the digital euro infrastructure to create new payment services, which would in turn increase innovation and competition in the European payments sector. A digital euro would also help regional and domestic European schemes to scale up the provision of their payment services in commercial bank money to a European scale by using the digital euro acceptance network. It would also expand the offer of private and public means of payment at the European level, thus supporting monetary sovereignty and strategic autonomy.
On1 November 2023 a two-year preparation phase was launched, which is currently laying the groundwork for the potential issuance of a digital euro.The primary objectives during this phase include providing a draft digital euro scheme rulebook, selecting potential providers for the digital euro platform and infrastructure and conducting further experimentation and stakeholder consultations to ensure a digital euro would meet the highest standards of quality, security, privacy and usability. By the end of 2025 the Governing Council will decide whether to move on to the next phase of preparations. The decision on whether to issue a digital euro will only be taken by the Governing Council once the European Union’s legislative framework has been adopted.
Timeline of the digital euro project

This report outlines the progress of the digital euro project over the six-month period from May to October 2024[1].
In the first quarter of 2024 the digital euro scheme’s Rulebook Development Group (RDG)[2]concluded a review of the first draft of the rulebook (version 0.8), having received and carefully assessed around 2,500 comments. Seven new RDG workstreams, composed of market participants and central banks, were launched in May 2024. These are focusing on key areas of the rulebook, including minimum user experience standards, risk management and implementation specifications. The next draft of the rulebook is expected to be finalised during the digital euro preparation phase and will include comments from the RDG interim review. The rulebookis essential to ensure that digital euro payments are accepted throughout the euro area, just like cash payments, and will work in a harmonised manner. The draft digital euro rulebook will be sufficiently flexible to accommodate any future adjustments and will be updated in accordance with the outcome of the digital euro legislative process.
The project team has made progress on the sourcing procedures for selecting potential providers for a digital euro service platform (DESP).An invitation to tender for external components was published and offers are currently being assessed. In addition, Eurosystem national central banks have been invited to submit offers for internal components.
Building on work carried out in the investigation phase, further experimentation and user research activities have now started, with the aim of gathering actionable insights into user preferences and informing decision-making.User research fieldwork started in September, the results of which will be published in mid-2025. Innovation partnerships with stakeholders, announced in a call in October, will test conditional payments and explore other innovative use cases for the digital euro, with an outcome report expected to be published in July 2025.
Work has also progressed on the design of a digital euro, specifically on (i) the calibration of the digital euro holding limit and(ii) thedeployment of the offline digital euro solution on the secure elements of mobile devices.The digital euro holding limit was discussed in a technical session with member associations of the Euro Retail Payments Board (ERPB[3]) on 16 July 2024, who shared their views on the factors influencing its calibration. In parallel, deployment options for an offline digital euro were identified and potential roles for the Eurosystem were outlined. Technical talks were conducted with mobile device manufacturers and specialised technical service providers in October 2024.
Extensive engagement with internal and external stakeholders has been a key focus.The ECB has been actively engaging with the public, market stakeholders and policymakers to ensure the digital euro meets the needs of all stakeholders, and with co-legislators to support the legislative process. Public communication efforts continued to focus on raising awareness about why a digital euro is needed and explaining its potential benefits for users. Market engagement took place through the ERPB technical sessions, the RDG and bilateral interactions, including meetings with the banking sector,merchants and consumers. Areas of focus in market engagement included the methodology for calibrating the holding limit and the fit of the digital euro in the payment ecosystem. At the technical level, the ECB has also engaged with European payment schemes and solutions and is talking to various international central banks about their respective progress in the area of central bank digital currency. The ECB continued to provide technical expertise in the context of legislative discussions with both the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union. Executive Board member Piero Cipollone took part in a public exchange of views on the digital euro at the meeting of the European Parliament’s Committee of Economic and Monetary Affairs on 23 September. The ECB also provided an update on the digital euro project to the Eurogroup in October 2024 and continues to extensively support the legislative debate at the technical level.
We are now halfway through the digital euro project preparation phase and remain committed to providing regular updates on the ongoing work and the progress made.The next progress report on the preparation phase will be published in the second quarter of 2025.
The digital euro scheme's rulebook will be based on extensive feedback from consumers, retailers, PSPs and central banks; it will be designed to be flexible to incorporate future adjustments.
In 2024 the RDG focused on two main streams of activity: reviewingthe first draft of the rulebook, version 0.8, and continuing to develop additional sections.The RDG represents the supply and demand sides of the market, including consumers, retailers, PSPs, Eurosystem central banks and observers from EU institutions. Version 0.8 of the rulebook was made available to RDG members at the beginning of 2024. It was drafted in line with the ECB's design decisions and legislative proposals in their then-current state and included core chapters about the scope, key actors, functional and operational model and technical requirements of the digital euro scheme. As part of thereview process, RDG members carried out extensive consultations with stakeholders, resulting in approximately 2,500 comments that helped to further develop the draft. These comments were carefully assessed and taken on board through updates to specific sections, clarifications or further technical work. RDG members also shared their views on the opportunities and challenges associated with a digital euro.
Comments from RDG members on first draft of the scheme rulebook, version 0.8

The RDG continued to draft and refine additional sections of the rulebook.Seven new workstreams were launched in May 2024,[4]to develop additional sections of the rulebook that were not covered in the first draft, and to further expand existing sections, such as the workstreams covering minimum user experience standards, certification and approval frameworks and risk management. These workstreams, composed of experts nominated by RDG members, have provided detailed suggestions for various aspects of the digital euro rulebook.
Details of the RDG review process, including the comprehensive feedback received on version 0.8 and the work of the different workstreams, were set out in theupdate published on 5 September2024.
The rulebook will be essential to standardise how the digital euro is used and managed seamlessly in the euro area, irrespective of the country or PSP so that, like a banknote, it can be used everywhere in the euro area.It will be an open standard that can also be leveraged by pan-European schemes. The draft digital euro rulebook will be sufficiently flexible to accommodate any future developments and will be updated in accordance with the outcome of the digital euro legislative process.
Comprehensive user research and technical experimentation activities are being conducted to gather actionable insights into user preferences and to develop innovative use cases for the digital euro.
Designing a digital euro that delivers value for end users is essential. We are building on the work conducted during the investigation phase by undertaking further research.The ECB has engaged a specialised provider to conduct comprehensive user research, which began in September 2024[5]. The aim of this research is to gather actionable insights into user preferences to enhance the digital euro's value proposition. Key focus areas include (i) a general segmentation analysis of the broader population – to identify which population segments would use a digital euro and what their needs are, (ii) user preferences for holding limits that will inform the technical work on the calibration models for holding limits (see also Section 4.1), and (iii) in-depth studies carried out with vulnerable groups and small merchants. The methodologies employed include surveys, focus groups, peer interviews and a standing online community for rapid consultation with users. The research findings are expected to be published in mid-2025.
In the area of technical experimentation with market participants, the goal is to stimulate engagement with the private sector through innovation partnerships and to further develop potentially innovative use cases.A workshop on the future of B2B payments was held on 9 October 2024as an open forum with industry and payment experts. Its purpose was to gather input on the challenges and needs arising from new use cases related to business-to-business (B2B) payments, beyond the current scope of the digital euro project on innovations in B2B payments.The workshop generated a large amount of interest, with more than 150 applications received. From these, six speakers were invited to take part from different sectors, including merchants, academics, representatives from financial services and banking and the travel industry. In parallel, the ECB has launched a joint (conceptual and technical) experimentation activity with PSPs and merchants to obtain a shared understanding of the requirements for facilitating conditional payments.A call was published on 31 October 2024and applicants will be invited to explore conditional payments and additional topics and use cases by the end of 2024. The work will take place in the first half of 2025. An outcome report that includes our partners’ conceptual and technical test findings is expected to be published in July 2025.
Overview of user research and experimentation work
The Eurosystem is developing a methodology for calibrating the digital euro holding limit, balancing optimal user experience with the need to maintain price and financial stability.
The Eurosystem is fully committed to ensuring that the introduction of the digital euro aligns with a resilient financial environment, allowing an effective transmission of its monetary policy.Setting the holding limit, or ""calibration"", involves balancing optimal user experience with the need to preserve the transmission of monetary policy and financial stability. These three pillars mirror the principles recognised in Article 15 of the legislative proposal. The ECB has been working with experts from national central banks (NCBs) and national competent authorities to develop a methodology for the calibration of the digital euro holding limit. At the technical session on a digital euro held on 16 July 2024, ERPB member associations shared their views on the factors influencing this calibration.[6]The input has been incorporated with a view to developing a comprehensive methodology for calibrating the digital euro holding limit.
Usability and ecosystem
Monetary policy and its implementation
Financial stability and banking supervision
On 30 September 2024a workshop entitled “Digital euro and its holding limit: how to calibrate it?”brought Eurosystem researchers, experts and policymakers together to further explore the holding limit topic.Bilateral engagement with European credit sector associations and their member institutions provided additional occasions for in-depth discussions with banks on the factors influencing the calibration of the digital euro holding limit. An update on the methodology is expected to be discussed with ERPB associations at the technical level before the end of 2024.
We are analysing how the offline digital euro solution can be deployed on the secure elements of mobile devices, holding technical talks with manufacturers and service providers.
The ECB has made progress in analysing how to deploy the offline digital euro solution on the secure elements of mobile devices.The secure element is a specialised hardware chip that enables offline digital euro transactions to be carried out directly on users' mobile devices. Due to its highly controlled environment, deploying an application remotely is complex and involves multiple stakeholders. The ECB has identified specific deployment options and outlined potential roles for the Eurosystem. To further clarify these roles, technical talks were conducted with mobile device manufacturers and specialised technical service providers in October 2024[8]. Furthermore, the ECB has worked with industry standard-setting bodies to analyse how existing standards can support the integration of the offline digital euro into current point of sale (POS) terminals. As part of this collaboration, they explored implementation possibilities and identified appropriate reusable standards. These standards will form the foundation for the technical integration work to be carried out by the provider of the offline solution.
Engaging with European stakeholders is at the core of the digital euro project. Over the past six months the Eurosystem has had extensive engagements with market stakeholders, co-legislators and the public.
Engagement with the market aims to gather input on the digital euro's integration into the Europeanpayments ecosystem, address challenges and explore new use cases, to ensure that a digital euro meets the needs of all stakeholders.
The ECB engaged with European market associations through two technical meetings of the ERPB, in which consumers, merchants and PSPs were represented.At the technical session held on 16 July 2024 the ECB provided an update on its plans to conduct user research[9](see also Section 3). At the same session, ERPB associations shared their views on the factors influencing the calibration of the digital euro holding limit (see also Section 4.1). This was complemented with a series of technical calls with bank experts to dive deeper into the factors considered for the calibration. The ERPB technical session held on 1 October 2024 included an update on the work of the digital euro scheme rulebook[10](see also Section 2) and kicked off the workstream set up to investigatehow a digital euro will fit into the Europeanpayments ecosystem (see also Section 5.2 for details). As part of this work, the ECB has planned multiple touchpoints with experts from ERPB associations, PSPs, merchant associations and consumer groups. ERPB technical sessions will continue throughout 2024 and 2025 and will cover, for example, the update on the methodology for calibrating digital euro holding limits.
In addition to structured engagement with the market through the ERPB, the ECB has engaged with consumers and merchants as end users of the digital euro ondifferent occasions.On 6 June 2024 a presentation to introduce the digital euro project was delivered to electrical retailers at the Strategic Session of the Annual General Meeting of Euronics. On 24 September 2024 the ECB participated in EuroCommerce Payments Day 2024. The ECB has included merchants in the future user research activities, ensuring their needs and concerns are captured for the development of a digital euro (see also Section 3). In September 2024 Executive Board member Piero Cipollone engaged in a round table discussion with the European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) to discuss the impact and opportunities of a digital euro.
Further bilateral engagement also took place with banks and other payment service providers.To gauge the potential for synergies by fostering standard harmonisation in the payments landscape, the ECB held bilateral meetings with major European payment schemes. By establishing open standards, the digital euro aims to integrate seamlessly into existing digital solutions and allow domestic schemes to leverage on a pan-European acceptance network (see also Section 5.2). Additionally, ECB President Christine Lagarde and Executive Board member Piero Cipollone took part in meetings with the European banking sector to discuss the implications and opportunities presented by a digital euro. These meetings emphasised the importance of collaborative efforts between major stakeholders to ensure its successful implementation and adoption.
The ECB is also providing information about a digital euro to market participants in dedicated sessions.On 9 September 2024 the ECB hosted anonline focus session, attended by over 1,000 financial industry experts, to provide an update on (i) the progress of the digital euro project, (ii) the drafting of the digital euro rulebook, and (iii) the impact and opportunities of a digital euro for the financial industry.
The digital euro project aims to provide a pan-European retail digital payment solution, reducing our dependence on non-European providers and enhancing the resilience and strategic autonomy of Europe's payment ecosystem.
A technical workstream with market participants is investigating how a digital euro will fit into the European payment ecosystem.The current payment landscape in Europe lacks a pan-European retail digital payment solution. Domestic schemes and private initiatives are competing with international card schemes. The increasing popularity of digital wallets provided by non-European players poses an additional challenge. This reliance on non-European providers creates undesired dependence and potential vulnerabilities in payment resilience. The aim of a digital euro is to address these issues for the benefit of Europeans – consumers, merchants, PSPs[11]. Expanding our engagement with market stakeholders on the fit of the digital euro in the payment ecosystem,an ERPB technical session was held on 1 October 2024. The session first highlighted that a digital euro would guarantee merchants increased access to a European consumer base. Unlike most current payment methods, it would provide an efficient way to settle payments instantly. Additionally, there would be rules in place to ensure that the fees merchants pay are fair, given its status as legal tender. Second, consumers would have access to public money in digital form, which would provide a high level of privacy in their everyday payments and ultimately increase competition in the payments market. Third, the digital euro project has made deliberate choices to support the business models of European PSPs and strengthen their position vis-à-vis dominant international players, by:
More technical sessions to be held between the fourth quarter of 2024 and the second quarter of 2025 will revolve around the themes of competition, synergies and business models for PSPs.Further discussions on the value proposition of the digital euro for merchants and consumers will follow in 2025.
Engagements with co-legislators included workshops, technical input and bilateral outreach to discuss political priorities and facilitate progress in the legislative process.
The ECB regularly exchanges views with the European co-legislators on its progress on the design of the digital euro.Executive Board memberPiero Cipollone took part in an exchange of views with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament on 23 September 2024to explain the role of the digital euro in enhancing the autonomy of the European payment sector.The ECB also provided technical updates to the Eurogroup on 7 October 2024, as part of its regular updates on the progress on the design of the digital euro.
In parallel to the ECB’s digital euro project, the European co-legislators are discussing the legal framework for the digital euro, based on aproposal for a Digital Euro Regulation issued by the European Commission in July 2023. When requested, the ECB provides technical input that informs both the European Parliament and the Council on their work. This section provides a brief overview of the key areas in which the ECB has provided technical information in its role as an observer in the Council Working Party that discusses the legislative proposal. The technical information is based on its expertise and the views summarised in the Opinion on the legislative proposal as adopted by the Governing Council.
In parallel, the ECB has continued to pursue a close cooperation with the European Commission.
Public communication efforts have continued to focus on raising awareness about the necessity of a digital euro and explaining its potential benefits for users through various channels.These have included website and social media communications, as well as media outreach. Public communication activities are crucial to ensuring potential users can be informed with accurate and reliable information about the digital euro, its importance and the benefits it could bring to the European payment landscape and their daily lives. This was the key message of the latestECB blog post “The digital euro: what’s in it for you?”authored by Executive Board member Piero Cipollone. It was also published as an Op-Ed across the euro area, reaching millions of citizens.[13]As part of its public outreach work, the ECB also engages directly with consumer groups that are not represented in the ERPB, which are given the opportunity to share their perspectives at theECB’s civil society seminars. The most recent seminar took place on 8 July 2024 and provided an update on the project's progress[14].
Over the coming months, the RDG will produce a revised draft of the rulebook, incorporating feedback from the first draft (version 0.8).This version will include new chapters and further develop existing ones, reflecting the ongoing work of the RDG. The final draft will be completed during the digital euro preparation phase. Additionally, a progress report on the RDG's work will be shared in the first quarter of 2025.
Following the discussions and insights obtained from the October ERPB technical session, future sessions to be held between the fourth quarter of 2024 and the second quarter of 2025 will address the core themes of competition, synergies and business models for PSPs.The aim of these sessions is to identify benefits and reduce potential risks or unintended consequences of a digital euro. These discussions, enriched by internal analyses, will ensure that all viewpoints are considered.
In the area of user research, the team will focus on a general segmentation analysis, user preferences for holding limits and in-depth studies carried out with vulnerable groups and small merchants.The research findings will be published in mid-2025. In parallel, the team will establish innovation partnerships with stakeholders to explore conditional payments and additional topics and use cases, with an outcome report expected to be published in July 2025.
In 2025 the ECB aims to conclude the procurement to select potential providers for the DESP.This will include evaluating offers for external components from external providers and offers for internal components from Eurosystem NCBs.
The ECB will continue to focus on public communication to raise awareness about a digital euro.The next ECB civil society seminar, focusing on financial inclusion, is scheduled for 13 November 2024 and will involve associations that protect the rights of consumers, citizens with disabilities and young people.
The next progress report on the preparation phase will be published in the second quarter of 2025.

The Eurosystem’s digital euro project aims to make central bank money available to the public in digital form.As e-commerce evolves and people increasingly prefer to make payments using electronic means, a digital euro would bring the valued features of banknotes into the digital sphere.The aim of a digital euro is to bring value to consumers, merchants and intermediaries, while reducing Europe’s dependence on international card schemes and non-European digital payment wallet providers. A digital euro would complement cash by providing a digital payment option for consumers that is free, safe and easy to use. It would facilitate electronic payments everywhere in the euro area and increase competitiveness in the payments market for merchants.Payment service providers (PSPs) would be able to use the digital euro infrastructure to create new payment services, which would in turn increase innovation and competition in the European payments sector. A digital euro would also help regional and domestic European schemes to scale up the provision of their payment services in commercial bank money to a European scale by using the digital euro acceptance network. It would also expand the offer of private and public means of payment at the European level, thus supporting monetary sovereignty and strategic autonomy.
On1 November 2023 a two-year preparation phase was launched, which is currently laying the groundwork for the potential issuance of a digital euro.The primary objectives during this phase include providing a draft digital euro scheme rulebook, selecting potential providers for the digital euro platform and infrastructure and conducting further experimentation and stakeholder consultations to ensure a digital euro would meet the highest standards of quality, security, privacy and usability. By the end of 2025 the Governing Council will decide whether to move on to the next phase of preparations. The decision on whether to issue a digital euro will only be taken by the Governing Council once the European Union’s legislative framework has been adopted.
Timeline of the digital euro project

This report outlines the progress of the digital euro project over the six-month period from May to October 2024[1].
In the first quarter of 2024 the digital euro scheme’s Rulebook Development Group (RDG)[2]concluded a review of the first draft of the rulebook (version 0.8), having received and carefully assessed around 2,500 comments. Seven new RDG workstreams, composed of market participants and central banks, were launched in May 2024. These are focusing on key areas of the rulebook, including minimum user experience standards, risk management and implementation specifications. The next draft of the rulebook is expected to be finalised during the digital euro preparation phase and will include comments from the RDG interim review. The rulebookis essential to ensure that digital euro payments are accepted throughout the euro area, just like cash payments, and will work in a harmonised manner. The draft digital euro rulebook will be sufficiently flexible to accommodate any future adjustments and will be updated in accordance with the outcome of the digital euro legislative process.
The project team has made progress on the sourcing procedures for selecting potential providers for a digital euro service platform (DESP).An invitation to tender for external components was published and offers are currently being assessed. In addition, Eurosystem national central banks have been invited to submit offers for internal components.
Building on work carried out in the investigation phase, further experimentation and user research activities have now started, with the aim of gathering actionable insights into user preferences and informing decision-making.User research fieldwork started in September, the results of which will be published in mid-2025. Innovation partnerships with stakeholders, announced in a call in October, will test conditional payments and explore other innovative use cases for the digital euro, with an outcome report expected to be published in July 2025.
Work has also progressed on the design of a digital euro, specifically on (i) the calibration of the digital euro holding limit and(ii) thedeployment of the offline digital euro solution on the secure elements of mobile devices.The digital euro holding limit was discussed in a technical session with member associations of the Euro Retail Payments Board (ERPB[3]) on 16 July 2024, who shared their views on the factors influencing its calibration. In parallel, deployment options for an offline digital euro were identified and potential roles for the Eurosystem were outlined. Technical talks were conducted with mobile device manufacturers and specialised technical service providers in October 2024.
Extensive engagement with internal and external stakeholders has been a key focus.The ECB has been actively engaging with the public, market stakeholders and policymakers to ensure the digital euro meets the needs of all stakeholders, and with co-legislators to support the legislative process. Public communication efforts continued to focus on raising awareness about why a digital euro is needed and explaining its potential benefits for users. Market engagement took place through the ERPB technical sessions, the RDG and bilateral interactions, including meetings with the banking sector,merchants and consumers. Areas of focus in market engagement included the methodology for calibrating the holding limit and the fit of the digital euro in the payment ecosystem. At the technical level, the ECB has also engaged with European payment schemes and solutions and is talking to various international central banks about their respective progress in the area of central bank digital currency. The ECB continued to provide technical expertise in the context of legislative discussions with both the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union. Executive Board member Piero Cipollone took part in a public exchange of views on the digital euro at the meeting of the European Parliament’s Committee of Economic and Monetary Affairs on 23 September. The ECB also provided an update on the digital euro project to the Eurogroup in October 2024 and continues to extensively support the legislative debate at the technical level.
We are now halfway through the digital euro project preparation phase and remain committed to providing regular updates on the ongoing work and the progress made.The next progress report on the preparation phase will be published in the second quarter of 2025.
The digital euro scheme's rulebook will be based on extensive feedback from consumers, retailers, PSPs and central banks; it will be designed to be flexible to incorporate future adjustments.
In 2024 the RDG focused on two main streams of activity: reviewingthe first draft of the rulebook, version 0.8, and continuing to develop additional sections.The RDG represents the supply and demand sides of the market, including consumers, retailers, PSPs, Eurosystem central banks and observers from EU institutions. Version 0.8 of the rulebook was made available to RDG members at the beginning of 2024. It was drafted in line with the ECB's design decisions and legislative proposals in their then-current state and included core chapters about the scope, key actors, functional and operational model and technical requirements of the digital euro scheme. As part of thereview process, RDG members carried out extensive consultations with stakeholders, resulting in approximately 2,500 comments that helped to further develop the draft. These comments were carefully assessed and taken on board through updates to specific sections, clarifications or further technical work. RDG members also shared their views on the opportunities and challenges associated with a digital euro.
Comments from RDG members on first draft of the scheme rulebook, version 0.8

The RDG continued to draft and refine additional sections of the rulebook.Seven new workstreams were launched in May 2024,[4]to develop additional sections of the rulebook that were not covered in the first draft, and to further expand existing sections, such as the workstreams covering minimum user experience standards, certification and approval frameworks and risk management. These workstreams, composed of experts nominated by RDG members, have provided detailed suggestions for various aspects of the digital euro rulebook.
Details of the RDG review process, including the comprehensive feedback received on version 0.8 and the work of the different workstreams, were set out in theupdate published on 5 September2024.
The rulebook will be essential to standardise how the digital euro is used and managed seamlessly in the euro area, irrespective of the country or PSP so that, like a banknote, it can be used everywhere in the euro area.It will be an open standard that can also be leveraged by pan-European schemes. The draft digital euro rulebook will be sufficiently flexible to accommodate any future developments and will be updated in accordance with the outcome of the digital euro legislative process.
Comprehensive user research and technical experimentation activities are being conducted to gather actionable insights into user preferences and to develop innovative use cases for the digital euro.
Designing a digital euro that delivers value for end users is essential. We are building on the work conducted during the investigation phase by undertaking further research.The ECB has engaged a specialised provider to conduct comprehensive user research, which began in September 2024[5]. The aim of this research is to gather actionable insights into user preferences to enhance the digital euro's value proposition. Key focus areas include (i) a general segmentation analysis of the broader population – to identify which population segments would use a digital euro and what their needs are, (ii) user preferences for holding limits that will inform the technical work on the calibration models for holding limits (see also Section 4.1), and (iii) in-depth studies carried out with vulnerable groups and small merchants. The methodologies employed include surveys, focus groups, peer interviews and a standing online community for rapid consultation with users. The research findings are expected to be published in mid-2025.
In the area of technical experimentation with market participants, the goal is to stimulate engagement with the private sector through innovation partnerships and to further develop potentially innovative use cases.A workshop on the future of B2B payments was held on 9 October 2024as an open forum with industry and payment experts. Its purpose was to gather input on the challenges and needs arising from new use cases related to business-to-business (B2B) payments, beyond the current scope of the digital euro project on innovations in B2B payments.The workshop generated a large amount of interest, with more than 150 applications received. From these, six speakers were invited to take part from different sectors, including merchants, academics, representatives from financial services and banking and the travel industry. In parallel, the ECB has launched a joint (conceptual and technical) experimentation activity with PSPs and merchants to obtain a shared understanding of the requirements for facilitating conditional payments.A call was published on 31 October 2024and applicants will be invited to explore conditional payments and additional topics and use cases by the end of 2024. The work will take place in the first half of 2025. An outcome report that includes our partners’ conceptual and technical test findings is expected to be published in July 2025.
Overview of user research and experimentation work
The Eurosystem is developing a methodology for calibrating the digital euro holding limit, balancing optimal user experience with the need to maintain price and financial stability.
The Eurosystem is fully committed to ensuring that the introduction of the digital euro aligns with a resilient financial environment, allowing an effective transmission of its monetary policy.Setting the holding limit, or ""calibration"", involves balancing optimal user experience with the need to preserve the transmission of monetary policy and financial stability. These three pillars mirror the principles recognised in Article 15 of the legislative proposal. The ECB has been working with experts from national central banks (NCBs) and national competent authorities to develop a methodology for the calibration of the digital euro holding limit. At the technical session on a digital euro held on 16 July 2024, ERPB member associations shared their views on the factors influencing this calibration.[6]The input has been incorporated with a view to developing a comprehensive methodology for calibrating the digital euro holding limit.
Usability and ecosystem
Monetary policy and its implementation
Financial stability and banking supervision
On 30 September 2024a workshop entitled “Digital euro and its holding limit: how to calibrate it?”brought Eurosystem researchers, experts and policymakers together to further explore the holding limit topic.Bilateral engagement with European credit sector associations and their member institutions provided additional occasions for in-depth discussions with banks on the factors influencing the calibration of the digital euro holding limit. An update on the methodology is expected to be discussed with ERPB associations at the technical level before the end of 2024.
We are analysing how the offline digital euro solution can be deployed on the secure elements of mobile devices, holding technical talks with manufacturers and service providers.
The ECB has made progress in analysing how to deploy the offline digital euro solution on the secure elements of mobile devices.The secure element is a specialised hardware chip that enables offline digital euro transactions to be carried out directly on users' mobile devices. Due to its highly controlled environment, deploying an application remotely is complex and involves multiple stakeholders. The ECB has identified specific deployment options and outlined potential roles for the Eurosystem. To further clarify these roles, technical talks were conducted with mobile device manufacturers and specialised technical service providers in October 2024[8]. Furthermore, the ECB has worked with industry standard-setting bodies to analyse how existing standards can support the integration of the offline digital euro into current point of sale (POS) terminals. As part of this collaboration, they explored implementation possibilities and identified appropriate reusable standards. These standards will form the foundation for the technical integration work to be carried out by the provider of the offline solution.
Engaging with European stakeholders is at the core of the digital euro project. Over the past six months the Eurosystem has had extensive engagements with market stakeholders, co-legislators and the public.
Engagement with the market aims to gather input on the digital euro's integration into the Europeanpayments ecosystem, address challenges and explore new use cases, to ensure that a digital euro meets the needs of all stakeholders.
The ECB engaged with European market associations through two technical meetings of the ERPB, in which consumers, merchants and PSPs were represented.At the technical session held on 16 July 2024 the ECB provided an update on its plans to conduct user research[9](see also Section 3).

Call for candidates to participate in the digital euro scheme
workstream A3: “Brand rules”
The European Central Bank (ECB) is inviting leading experts in branding and
communication with advanced knowledge of payments and digital money to
contribute to the brand rules workstream. This workstream, along with several others,
is part of the Rulebook Development Group set up by the Chair of the digital euro
scheme to support the drafting of the rulebook.
The main objective of workstream A3 is to develop a proposal for brand rules that
participants in the digital euro scheme, i.e. supervised payment service providers
(PSPs), will adopt for their end-user solutions. This excludes brand strategy,
expression and the visual identity of the digital euro.
The proposal should include content recommendations for the following section of
the rulebook:
• Annexes (Implementation Specifications): Brand rules
The workstream will consist of market participants and Eurosystem representatives.
Candidates should be proficient in English as a working language and have
experience of working in multi-stakeholder groups.
The workstream is to hold frequent remote meetings over a period of six weeks,
starting between February and March 2025. Members of the workstream will be
expected to participate in all meetings and actively contribute to the deliverables.
Candidates interested in joining should submit a curriculum vitae (CV) highlighting
their experience in the areas mentioned above. They should also answer the
following questions in writing, in a total of no more than 3,500 words:
1. In your opinion what brand rules need to be established for the application of
the digital euro brand by PSPs?
2. What brand rules do you suggest introducing to ensure a consistent brand
experience for end users?
3. What considerations should guide the Eurosystem when deciding on the
brand rules to be established and which aspects might be more effectively
managed by the market?
Candidates are also asked to include a letter of consent from their employer. A
nomination letter from either a representative payment stakeholder association or aECB-PUBLIC
ECB-UNRESTRICTED
member of the digital euro scheme Rulebook Development Group would be
considered an advantage. The requisite documents should be sent to the email
address DigitalEuro-RBD@ecb.europa.eu by 29 December 2024.
Participants are expected to contribute in their personal capacity. However, if a
participant is sponsored by a specific stakeholder association, they are also expected
to collaborate with that association. This includes keeping it informed about the
progress of their work and gathering feedback and input that aligns with the
association’s goals.
All applications will be treated confidentially. The list of successful candidates will,
however, be made public.
The ECB is an inclusive institution, and we strive to reflect the diversity of the
population we serve. We encourage you to apply irrespective of age, disability,
ethnicity, gender, gender identity, race, religious beliefs, sexual orientation or other
characteristics.
Participation in the workstream will not be remunerated. All intellectual property
rights, copyright and rights to development and disposal related to the deliverables of
the workstream shall reside exclusively with the ECB.
