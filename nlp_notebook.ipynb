      "area financing conditions, while services remain resilient.\n",
      "The labour market remains a source of strength. Almost a million new jobs were added in the first\n",
      "quarter of the year and the unemployment rate stood at its historical low of 6.5 per cent in April. The\n",

      "As the energy crisis fades, governments should roll back the related support measures promptly and\n",
      "in a concerted manner to avoid driving up medium-term inflationary pressures, which would call for a\n",
      "stronger monetary policy response. Fiscal policies should be designed to make our economy more\n",
      "productive and gradually bring down high public debt. Policies to enhance the euro area’s supply\n",
      "capacity, especially in the energy sector, can also help reduce price pressures in the medium term.\n",
      "The reform of the EU’s economic governance framework should be concluded soon.\n",
      "Inflation\n",
      "Inflation fell further to 6.1 per cent in May, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, from 7.0 per cent in\n",
      "April. The decline was broad-based. Energy price inflation, which had risen in April, resumed its\n",
      "downward trend and was negative in May. Food price inflation fell again but remained high at 12.5 per\n",
      "cent.\n",
      "Inflation excluding energy and food declined in May for the second month in a row, to 5.3 per cent\n",
      "from 5.6 per cent in April. Goods inflation decreased further, to 5.8 per cent from 6.2 per cent in April.\n",
      "Services inflation fell for the first time in several months, from 5.2 per cent to 5.0 per cent. Indicators of\n",
      "underlying price pressures remain strong, although some show tentative signs of softening.Past increases in energy costs are still pushing up prices across the economy. Pent-up demand from\n",
      "the reopening of the economy also continues to drive up inflation, especially in services. Wage\n",
      "pressures, while partly reflecting one-off payments, are becoming an increasingly important source of\n",
      "inflation. Compensation per employee rose by 5.2 per cent in the first quarter of the year and\n",
      "negotiated wages by 4.3 per cent. Moreover, firms in some sectors have been able to keep profits\n",
      "relatively high, especially where demand has outstripped supply. Although most measures of longer-\n",
      "term inflation expectations currently stand at around 2 per cent, some indicators remain elevated and\n",
      "need to be monitored closely.\n",
      "Risk assessment\n",
      "The outlook for economic growth and inflation remains highly uncertain. Downside risks to growth\n",
      "include Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine and an increase in broader geopolitical tensions,\n",
      "which could fragment global trade and thus weigh on the euro area economy. Growth could also be\n",
      "slower if the effects of monetary policy are more forceful than projected. Renewed financial market\n",
      "tensions could lead to even tighter financing conditions than anticipated and weaken confidence. Also,\n",
      "weaker growth in the world economy could further dampen economic activity in the euro area.\n",
      "However, growth could be higher than projected if the strong labour market and receding uncertainty\n",
      "mean that people and businesses become more confident and spend more.\n",
      "Upside risks to inflation include potential renewed upward pressures on the costs of energy and food,\n",
      "also related to Russia’s war against Ukraine. A lasting rise in inflation expectations above our target,\n",
      "or higher than anticipated increases in wages or profit margins, could also drive inflation higher,\n",
      "including over the medium term. Recent wage agreements in a number of countries have added to the\n",
      "upside risks to inflation. By contrast, renewed financial market tensions could bring inflation down\n",
      "faster than projected. Weaker demand, for example due to a stronger transmission of monetary policy,\n",
      "would also lead to lower price pressures, especially over the medium term. Moreover, inflation would\n",
      "come down faster if declining energy prices and lower food price increases were to pass through to\n",
      "other goods and services more quickly than currently anticipated.\n",
      "Financial and monetary conditions\n",
      "Our monetary policy tightening continues to be reflected in risk-free interest rates and broader\n",
      "financing conditions. Funding conditions are tighter for banks and credit is becoming more expensive\n",
      "for firms and households. In April lending rates reached their highest level in more than a decade,\n",
      "standing at 4.4 per cent for business loans and 3.4 per cent for mortgages.These higher borrowing rates, together with tighter credit supply conditions and lower loan demand,\n",
      "have further weakened credit dynamics. The annual growth of loans to firms declined again in April, to\n",
      "4.6 per cent. The month-on-month changes have been negative on average since November. Loans\n",
