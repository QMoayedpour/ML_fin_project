      "The results reported in the October 2023 bank lending survey (BLS) relate to changes observed during the third quarter of 2023 and expectations for the fourth quarter of 2023. The survey was conducted between 15 September and 2 October 2023.A total of 157 banks were surveyed in this round, with a response rate of 100%. In addition to results for the euro area as a whole, this report contains results for the four largest euro area countries.[1]\n",
      "A number of ad hoc questions were included in the October 2023 survey. They address the impact of the situation in financial markets on banks’ access to retail and wholesale funding, the impact of the ECB’s monetary policy asset portfolio and TLTRO III on banks and their lending policies, and the impact of key ECB interest rate decisions on bank profitability.\n",
      "In the October 2023 BLS, euro area banks indicated that their credit standards for loans or credit lines to enterprises tightened further in the third quarter of 2023. The cumulative tightening since 2022 has been substantial, which is consistent with the ongoing significant weakening in lending dynamics. The net percentage of banks reporting a tightening moderated somewhat compared with the previous quarter but was slightly larger than banks had expected in the previous quarter. Euro area banks expect a further tightening for loans to firms in the fourth quarter of 2023, albeit at a moderating pace.\n",
      "Banks reported a further net tightening of credit standards for loans to households in the third quarter of 2023, which strongly exceeded previous expectations. For housing loans, the pace of net tightening even picked up compared with the second quarter. Credit standards on loans for consumer credit and other lending tightened further, at a slightly moderating pace. In the fourth quarter of 2023, euro area banks expect credit standards for housing loans to remain broadly unchanged, while a further net tightening is expected for consumer credit and other loans to households.\n",
      "Firms’ net demand for loans continued to decrease substantially in the third quarter of 2023. Similar to recent quarters, the decline in net demand was significantly stronger than expected by banks, mainly driven by lower fixed investment and higher interest rates. The net percentage of banks reporting a decrease was only slightly more contained than the all-time low of the previous quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2023, banks expect a smaller net decrease in demand for loans to firms.\n",
      "The net decrease in housing loan demand remained substantial and stronger than previously expected, albeit smaller than the all-time low in the fourth quarter of 2022. The net decrease in demand for consumer credit was also stronger than expected in the previous quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2023, banks expect a less pronounced decrease in the demand for housing loans and for consumer credit than in the third quarter.\n",
      "The October 2023 BLS contained a number of ad hoc questions. Euro area banks’ access to fundingdeteriorated in all market segments in the third quarter of 2023, especially for access to retail funding. The reduction in ECB’s monetary policy asset portfolio is contributing to a deterioration in euro area banks’ financing and liquidity conditions, resulting in the build-up of further tightening pressure on the supply of credit. Banks indicated a negative impact of the phase-out of TLTRO III on their liquidity and funding conditions over the past six months, leading to a mild tightening effect on terms and conditions and a downward pressure on loan volumes which are expected to intensify in the coming six months. Euro area banks reported a further markedly positive impact of the key ECB interest rate decisions on their net interest margins over the past six months, although the positive impact is expected to gradually abate in the coming six months.\n",
      "In more detail, euro area banks further tightened their credit standards (i.e., banks’ internal guidelines or loan approval criteria) in net terms for loans or credit lines to enterprises in the third quarter of 2023 (net percentage of banks at 12%, after 14% in the second quarter of 2023; see Overview table). The cumulated tightening since 2022 has been substantial, which is consistent with the ongoing significant weakening in lending dynamics. Banks’ risk perceptions continued to have the largest tightening impact, while banks’ lower risk tolerance also contributed. Banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet situations also contributed to the tightening, albeit to a lesser extent, with banks’ lower liquidity positions being the main driver. The net tightening moderated slightly compared with the previous quarter but remained above its historical average (9%; see Overview table) for the sixth quarter in a row since the second quarter of 2022. The net tightening was slightly larger than banks had expected in the previous quarter (10%). In the fourth quarter of 2023, euro area banks expect a further but more moderate pace of tightening for loans to firms (net percentage of 7%).\n",
      "Euro area banks reported a further net tightening of credit standards for loans to households strongly exceeding previous expectations, for both housing loans (net percentage of banks at 11%, after 8% in the second quarter of 2023; see Overview table) and consumer credit (16%, after 18%). For housing loans, while remaining below the peak observed in the third quarter of 2022 (32%), the net tightening was much greater than banks’ expectations in the previous quarter (expected net percentage of 0%). For consumer credit, the net tightening was also substantially higher than banks’ expectations (expected net percentage of 2%). The main drivers of the tightening for both housing loans and consumer credit were higher risk perceptions and banks’ lower risk tolerance. Meanwhile, the contribution of banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet conditions was broadly neutral. In the fourth quarter of 2023, banks expect broadly unchanged credit standards for housing loans (net percentage of 1%). By contrast, banks expect a further net tightening of credit standards for consumer credit (net percentage of 12%).\n",
      "Banks’ overall terms and conditions (i.e., banks’ actual terms and conditions agreed in the loan contract) tightened further, especially for housing loans for which the tightening pace was higher compared with the previous quarter. For firms, the net tightening, albeit smaller than in the previous quarter, was non-negligible and added to the tightening of the past quarters (net percentage of 8%, after 23%). Margins on riskier loans widened further in line with the tightening impact of banks’ risk perceptions and lower risk tolerance. Margins on average loans had a small net tightening impact, alongside collateral requirements. Banks reported a further net tightening of overall terms and conditions for housing loans, with the pace even accelerating compared with the previous quarter (net percentage of 19%, after 15%), while net tightening decelerated for consumer credit and other lending to households (8%, after 21%). For all types of lending to households, the tightening was mainly on account of widening margins on both riskier loans and average loans.\n",
      "In the third quarter of 2023, banks continued to report a net increase in the share of rejected applications across all loan segments. For loans to firms, the net increase stood at 8%, after 16% in the second quarter of 2023. In net terms, an increase in the share of rejected loans for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) was mentioned almost as often as for large firms, but the cumulated increase in rejection rates for SMEs has been higher since the start of the monetary policy tightening in 2022, in line with these firms being associated with higher credit risks on average. For housing loans, euro area banks reported a higher net increase in the share of rejected applications compared with the previous quarter (12%, after 8%). For consumer credit, the net increase in the share of rejected loans also increased (13%, after 10%). Both forms of lending to households have rejection rates below their peaks in the second half of 2022 but above the series’ averages of 5% and 3% respectively.\n",
      "Credit standards for loans to enterprises tightened in net terms in all four of the largest euro area countries in the third quarter of 2023 (see Overview table). The tightening pace remained unchanged from the previous quarter in Germany, Spain and Italy, while it was smaller in France. Credit standards for housing loans tightened in Germany, France and especially Spain while they remained unchanged in Italy. Credit standards for consumer credit tightened in all four largest euro area countries.\n",
      "Firms’ net demand for loans continued to decrease substantially in the third quarter of 2023 (net percentage of -36%, after -42% in the second quarter of 2023; see Overview table), with the net percentage of banks reporting a decrease only slightly more contained than the all-time low of the previous quarter. Similar to recent quarters, the decline was significantly stronger than expected by banks. The general level of interest rates remained the main driver of reduced loan demand. In line with the previous quarters, fixed investment also had a strong dampening impact on loan demand, mirrored by a strong net decrease in demand for long-term loans. Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity (included in “other financing needs”) also dampened loan demand, while demand for inventories and working capital had a neutral impact. In the fourth quarter of 2023, banks expect a smaller net decrease in demand for loans to firms compared with the third quarter.\n",
      "The net decrease in demand for housing loans remained strong in the third quarter of 2023 but was lower than earlier this year (net percentage of -45%, after -47% and -72% in the second and first quarter of 2023 respectively; see Overview table). The net decrease in demand was stronger than anticipated in the previous quarter (-18%). The decrease was driven primarily by higher interest rates, with an additional substantial contribution from weakening housing market prospects and low consumer confidence. The net decrease in demand for consumer credit was in line with the previous quarter (both net percentages of -12%, see Overview table) though stronger than previously expected (-8%). Similarly, this was driven primarily by the general level of interest rates, together with low consumer confidence and lower spending on durables. In the fourth quarter of 2023, banks expect a substantially less pronounced decrease in housing loan demand (net percentage of -11%) and a somewhat smaller net decrease in demand for consumer credit (-7%) than in the third quarter.\n",
      "Banks reported a substantial net decrease in demand for loans to enterprises across all four largest euro area countries in the third quarter of 2023. Demand for housing loans and for consumer credit also continued to decrease in net terms in all four largest euro area countries.\n",

      "Notes: “Avg.” refers to historical averages, which are calculated over the period since the beginning of the survey, excluding the most recent round. Owing to the different sample sizes across countries, which broadly reflect the differences in the national shares in lending to the euro area non-financial private sector, the size and volatility of the net percentages cannot be directly compared across countries.\n",
      "Euro area banks’ access to funding deteriorated in all market segments in the third quarter of 2023, especially for access toretail funding. The pronounced deterioration in access to short-term retail funding (11% in net terms, following 14% which was the highest since the first quarter of 2012) is consistent with the higher competition for liquidity stemming from other banks and from alternative investment opportunities offering higher remuneration. For debt securities, money markets and securitisations, the deterioration was less pronounced.\n",
      "The reduction in the ECB’s monetary policy asset portfolio is contributing to a deterioration in euro area banks’ financing and liquidity conditions, resulting in the build-up of further tightening pressure on the supply of credit. Banks reported further negative impacts on their market financing conditions (net percentage of -15%, after -16%) and liquidity positions (net percentage of -9%, after -7%), with a further deterioration expected over the next six months. The impact of the ECB’s monetary policy asset portfolio on profitability was positive overall over the past six months, with a positive contribution from net interest income and a negative contribution from capital losses, with the two expected to balance out over the next six months. There was also a continued net tightening impact of the ECB’s monetary policy asset portfolio on terms and conditions and a negative impact on lending volumes, with stronger effects expected over the next six months across all loan categories.\n",
      "Banks indicated a negative impact of the phase-out of TLTRO III on their liquidity and funding conditions over the past six months, leading to a mild tightening effect on terms and conditions and a downward pressure on loan volumes, which are expected to intensify in the coming six months. The negative impact of TLTRO III repayments on liquidity positions (a net percentage of -20%, after -5% in the previous six months) and profitability (-10%, after -7%) was complemented by a negative impact on market financing conditions (-8%, after 0%). Banks expect a further negative impact of the phase-out of TLTRO III on their financial situation over the next six months. Regarding their lending conditions, banks reported a net tightening impact of the phase-out of TLTRO III on their terms and conditions and a slightly negative impact on lending volumes across all forms of lending. Banks expect a similar additional tightening on terms and conditions over the next six months alongside a slightly larger negative impact on lending volumes.\n",
      "Euro area banks reported a further markedly positive impact of the key ECB interest rate decisions on their net interest margins over the past six months, although the positive impact is expected to gradually abate in the coming six months. Similar to the previous six months, the positive impact on bank interest margins also translated into a high share of banks reporting a positive impact of the ECB rate hikes on their net interest income, which led to a largely positive effect on their overall profitability. At the same time, there was a substantial increase in the share of banks reporting a negative impact of the ECB interest rate decisions on volumes, consistent with the significant weakening in lending dynamics. Moreover, euro area banks reported a further negative impact via higher provisioning needs and impairments, whereas negative impacts via capital losses and lower net fee and commission income became less pronounced. The net percentage of banks reporting a positive impact of the key ECB interest rate decisions on their net interest margins is expected to be considerably smaller over the next six months (at 20%) compared with the past six months (43%) and compared with the share of banks reporting a negative impact on volumes over the same period (31%, unchanged from 32% over the past six months). Non-interest income and provisions and impairments are also expected to exert downward pressure on bank profitability over the next six months.\n",
      "The bank lending survey (BLS) is addressed to senior loan officers at a representative sample of euro area banks. In the current round, 157 banks were surveyed, representing all euro area countries and reflecting the characteristics of their respective national banking structures. The main purpose of the BLS is to enhance the Eurosystem’s knowledge of bank lending conditions in the euro area.[2]\n",
      "The BLS questionnaire contains 22 standard questions on past and expected future developments: 18 backward-looking questions and four forward-looking questions. In addition, it contains one open-ended question. Those questions focus on developments in loans to euro area residents (i.e., domestic and euro area cross-border loans) and distinguish between three loan categories: loans or credit lines to enterprises; loans to households for house purchase; and consumer credit and other lending to households. For all three categories, questions are asked about the credit standards applied to the approval of loans, the terms and conditions of new loans, loan demand, the factors affecting loan supply and demand conditions, and the percentage of loan applications that are rejected. Survey questions are generally phrased in terms of changes over the past three months or expected changes over the next three months. Survey participants are asked to indicate in a qualitative way the strength of any tightening or easing or the strength of any decrease or increase, reporting changes using the following five-point scale: (1) tightened/decreased considerably, (2) tightened/decreased somewhat, (3) basically no change, (4) eased/increased somewhat, or (5) eased/increased considerably.\n",
      "In addition to the standard questions, the BLS questionnaire may contain ad hoc questions on specific topics of interest. Whereas the standard questions cover a three-month time period, the ad hoc questions tend to refer to changes over a longer time period (e.g. over the past and next six months).\n",
      "The responses of the individual banks participating in the BLS are aggregated in two steps to form the euro area results. In the first step, the responses of individual banks are aggregated to national results for the euro area countries. In the second step, the national BLS results are aggregated to euro area BLS results.\n",
      "In the first step, banks’ replies are aggregated to national BLS results for all countries by applying equal weights to all banks in the sample.[3]For two countries (Malta and Slovakia), national results are additionally aggregated by applying a weighting scheme based on the amounts outstanding of loans to non-financial corporations and households of the individual banks in the respective national samples.\n",
      "In the second step, since the numbers of banks in the national samples differ considerably and do not always reflect those countries’ respective shares in lending to euro area non-financial corporations and households, the unweighted national survey results of all countries are aggregated to euro area BLS results by applying a weighting scheme based on the national shares of outstanding loans to euro area non-financial corporations and households.\n",
      "Responses to questions relating to credit standards are analysed in this report by looking at the difference (the “net percentage”) between the percentage of banks reporting that credit standards applied in the approval of loans have been tightened and the percentage of banks reporting that they have been eased. For all questions, the net percentage is determined on the basis of all participating banks that have business in or exposure to the respective loan categories (i.e., they are all included in the denominator when calculating the net percentage). This means that banks that specialise in certain loan categories (e.g. banks that only grant loans to enterprises) are only included in the aggregation for those categories. All other participating banks are included in the aggregation of all questions, even if a bank replies that a question is “not applicable” (“NA”). This harmonised aggregation method was introduced by the Eurosystem in the April 2018 BLS. It has been applied to all euro area and national BLS results in the current BLS questionnaire, including backdata.[4]The resulting revisions for the standard BLS questions have generally been small, but revisions for some ad hoc questions have been larger owing to a higher number of “not applicable” replies by banks.\n",
      "A positive net percentage indicates that a larger proportion of banks have tightened credit standards (“net tightening”), whereas a negative net percentage indicates that a larger proportion of banks have eased credit standards (“net easing”).\n",
      "Likewise, the term “net demand” refers to the difference between the percentage of banks reporting an increase in loan demand (i.e., an increase in bank loan financing needs) and the percentage of banks reporting a decline. Net demand will therefore be positive if a larger proportion of banks have reported an increase in loan demand, whereas negative net demand indicates that a larger proportion of banks have reported a decline in loan demand.\n",
      "In the assessment of survey balances for the euro area, net percentages between -1 and +1 are generally referred to as “broadly unchanged”. For country results, net percentage changes are reported in a factual manner, as differing sample sizes across countries mean that the answers of individual banks have differing impacts on the magnitude of net percentage changes.\n",
      "In addition to the “net percentage” indicator, the ECB also publishes an alternative measure of banks’ responses to questions relating to changes in credit standards and net demand. This measure is the weighted difference (“diffusion index”) between the percentage of banks reporting that credit standards have been tightened and the percentage of banks reporting that they have been eased. Likewise, as regards demand for loans, the diffusion index refers to the weighted difference between the percentage of banks reporting an increase in loan demand and the percentage of banks reporting a decline. The diffusion index is constructed in the following way: lenders who have answered “considerably” are given a weight (score of 1) which is twice as large as that given to lenders who have answered “somewhat” (score of 0.5). The interpretation of the diffusion indices follows the same logic as the interpretation of net percentages.\n",
      "Detailed tables and charts based on the responses provided can be found in Annex 1 for the standard questions and Annex 2 for the ad hoc questions. In addition, BLS time series data are available on the ECB’s website via theECB Data Portal.\n",
      "A copy of the questionnaire, a glossary of BLS terms and a BLS user guide with information on the BLS series keys can all be found on theECB's website.\n",
      "Euro area banks further tightened their credit standards for loans or credit lines to enterprises in the third quarter of 2023 (net percentage of banks of 12%, after 14% in the second quarter of 2023; see Chart 1 and Overview table).[5]The cumulative net tightening since the beginning of 2022 has been substantial, which is consistent with the ongoing significant weakening in lending dynamics. The net tightening moderated slightly compared with the previous quarter but remained above its historical average (9%; see Overview table) for the sixth quarter in a row since the second quarter of 2022. Credit standards tightened slightly more in net terms for loans to SMEs (net percentage of 14%, after 17%) than for loans to large firms (12%, after 13%; see Chart 2). In addition, the tightening was stronger for long-term loans (14%, after 15%) than for short-term loans (9%, after 10%).\n",
      "Banks’ risk perceptions continued to have the largest tightening impact, while banks’ lower risk tolerance and liquidity positions also contributed (see Chart 1 and Table 1). Risks related to the firm-specific situation and the economic outlook remained the main drivers of the tightening of credit standards for firms, reflecting higher credit risks in the context of increasing debt servicing costs for firms and weak economic growth. Banks’ lower risk tolerance also contributed to the tightening, albeit to a lesser extent. In this context, banks’ replies also mentioned prudence in their lending policies, when assessing the creditworthiness of individual firms, with respect to the risks related to the economic outlook and higher interest rates.Banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet situations also contributed to the tightening of credit standards, with banks’ lower liquidity positions being the main driver. The latter can reflect the decline in aggregate deposit volumes and increasing competition for deposits among banks, as well as the shrinking excess liquidity in the euro area banking system. Some banks mentioned the increase in interest rates and the ongoing increase in the costs of customer deposits as additional factors (included in “other factors”).[6]While risk perceptions were the main driver of tightening credit standards for both SMEs and large enterprises, their impact was higher for SMEs. This is in line with the higher credit risks associated with these firms on average.\n",

Higher risk perceptions were an important tightening factor in all four countries, while banks’ lower risk tolerance contributed to the further net tightening in Germany, Spain and Italy, but not in France.

      "Banks’ overall terms and conditions (i.e., actual terms and conditions agreed in the loan contract) for new loans to enterprises tightened further (net percentage of 8%, after 23%; see Chart 3 and Table 2). While the tightening pace was lower than in the second quarter, the net tightening added to the tightening of past quarters. Widening margins (defined as the spread over relevant market reference rates) on riskier loans to firms (net percentage of 11%) were the main driver behind the net tightening, in line with the tightening impact of banks’ risk perceptions and lower risk tolerance on credit standards. By contrast, margins on average loans had only a small net tightening impact (3%), alongside loan size and maturity (5% and 4% respectively, represented in “other terms and conditions”) as well as collateral requirements (3%). In line with these developments, banks also indicated in their replies, under “other factors”, their efforts to shift their loan books towards lower-risk borrowers. Banks reported a further net tightening of overall terms and conditions for loans to both SMEs (net percentage of 10%, after 20%; see Chart 4) and large firms (net percentage of 5%, after 19%; see Chart 4), with the net tightening moderating more for the latter loan segment. For both categories of lending, the net tightening was driven by a widening of margins on riskier loans. Margins on average loans had a moderate tightening impact on terms and conditions on loans to SMEs, while the impact was neutral for loans to large enterprises.\n",

Increased risk perceptions were primarily related to perceptions regarding borrower creditworthiness, the general economic outlook and, to a smaller extent, housing market prospects.

In addition to the standard factor related to cost of funds and balance sheet constraints, banks referred, under “other factors”, to liquidity costs as a factor contributing to a tightening. The tightening impact of increased risk perceptions was more limited. By contrast, competition had a net easing impact on terms and conditions.[7]\n",

In Germany, margins narrowed on average loans and widened on riskier loans. For Italy, the tightening impact mainly related to higher loan-to-value ratios and restrictions on loan sizes and maturities.\n",

Since the start of the ECB rate hikes in the third quarter of 2022, the general level of interest rates has been the main negative contributor to housing loan demand. This is in line with the continued increase in euro area mortgage rates. The negative impact of consumer confidence and housing market prospects was again sizeable in the third quarter of 2023, reflecting weakness in housing market dynamics as seen in the annual decline of the euro area house price index according to the latest data from Eurostat, and the low levels in the European Commission’s consumer confidence indicator. Other financing needs and the use of alternative finance (especially internal financing out of savings) contributed negatively to demand to a much smaller extent.\n",

It remains elevated relative to the series average since the first quarter of 2015 (net percentage of 3%).

The net percentages for the “other factors” refer to an average of the further factors which were mentioned by banks as having contributed to changes in loan demand.\n",
      "Higher interest rates primarily contributed to the decrease in demand, alongside a substantial contribution from low consumer confidence (see Chart 14 and Table 12). A net decline in spending on durable consumer goods also contributed to lower demand. The negative contribution of these factors is consistent with the dampening impact of high inflation on households’ real disposable income. The negative contribution of the use of alternative finance towards demand was minor overall, while banks reported an increased use of savings for financing by consumers.\n",
      "Across all four largest euro area countries, demand for consumer credit decreased. The general level of interest rates and low consumer confidence contributed negatively towards demand in all four countries. Decreased spending on durables also had a negative contribution in Germany, Spain and France, while increased spending on durables had a positive impact in Italy. The use of alternative finance, especially savings, had a relatively strong negative impact in Spain and France.\n",

      "Euro area banks’ access to funding deteriorated in all market segments in the third quarter of 2023, especially in retail funding (see Chart 15 and Table 13). The pronounced deterioration in access to retail funding (7%, which follows a net percentage of 6% the previous quarter, the highest on record since the first quarter of 2012) and especially short-term funding (11%, after 14%) is consistent with the higher competition for liquidity stemming from other banks and from alternative investment opportunities with higher remuneration. Ease of access to longer-term deposits only deteriorated slightly. For debt securities the deterioration was moderate, compared with a much larger deterioration throughout the earlier phase of the hiking cycle. There was heterogeneity across different maturities of debt securities as access to short-term debt securities funding improved slightly, while access to medium-to-long term debt securities deteriorated somewhat (net percentage of 6%). Banks also reported that access to money markets and securitisations deteriorated slightly (net percentage of 2% and 3% respectively).\n",

      "The reduction in ECB’s monetary policy asset portfolio contributed to a deterioration in euro area banks’ financing and liquidity conditions over the last six months (see Chart 16). Banks continued to report substantially negative impacts on their market financing conditions (net percentage of -15%, after -16%) and liquidity positions (net percentage of -9%, after -7%). The impact on banks’ profitability was positive overall for the first time since the series began (net percentage of 7%, after 1%), owing to the positive impact through net interest income and despite the negative impact through capital losses. These developments reflect the slowdown and eventual discontinuation of reinvestments under the ECB’s asset purchase programme (APP) started in March 2023. The impact on banks’ total assets was negative for the second quarter in a row (net percentage of -10%, after -4%). This deleveraging pressure is in line with the decrease in central bank liquidity as well as an additional weakening impact on bank credit.\n",

The impact on total assets is also expected to be negative. The impact on profitability is expected to turn neutral, with only a slightly positive contribution of net interest income (net percentage of 2%) compensated by a negative contribution from capital losses (net percentage of -4%).\n",

The negative impact of TLTRO III repayments on liquidity positions strengthened considerably compared with the previous six months (-5%), reflecting the very large repayments in June 2023. Profitability was also impacted negatively (-10%, after -7%). The impact on market financing conditions turned negative for the first time (-8%, after 0%), contributing to the already negative impact on overall funding conditions which hit a new trough over the past six months (net percentage of -12%; see Chart 20). The impact of outstanding TLTRO III on banks’ ability to fulfil regulatory or supervisory requirements remained slightly positive (net percentage of 3%), although less than before owing to the reduction in outstanding TLTRO III liquidity and its decreased residual maturity.\n",
      "Over the next six months, banks expect a further negative impact of the phase-out of TLTRO III on their financial situation, as repayments continue. The negative impact is expected to be greatest on their liquidity positions and profitability, while the negative impact on overall funding conditions is expected to be smaller.\n",

Regarding their credit standards, banks reported a slight tightening impact of TLTRO III on housing loans and consumer credit and a broadly neutral impact for loans to firms (net percentages of 2%, 2% and 1% respectively).\n",
      "The impact of TLTRO III on bank lending volumes was slightly negative across all categories of lending (see Chart 20). Banks reported a slightly negative impact of TLTRO III for loans to firms (-2%) and consumer credit (-2%) for the first time since this question was introduced and continued to report a moderately negative impact also for housing loans (-3%).\n",

      "Euro area banks reported a further markedly positive impact of the key ECB interest rate decisions on their net interest margins over the past six months (net percentage of 43%, after 49%; see Chart 21). Similar to the previous six months, the positive impact on bank interest margins translated into a high share of banks reporting a positive impact of the ECB rate hikes on their net interest income (43%, after 47%). At the same time, a substantial share of banks reported a negative impact of the ECB interest rate decisions on lending volumes. The net percentage was almost double that recorded in the previous six months (net percentage of 32%, after 17%), consistent with the significant weakening in lending dynamics. Banks also indicated a further dampening impact of the ECB rate hikes on profitability via higher provisioning needs and impairments over the past six months (net percentage of -11%, after -9%; see Chart 21), reflecting higher credit risks associated with a weakening impact of monetary policy tightening on economic activity and a rising interest burden of borrowers. In addition, negative impacts via capital losses and lower net fee and commission incomes became less pronounced, leading to a more moderate impact on the banks’ non-interest income (net percentage of -4%, after -11%; see also Chart 21). The expansion in intermediation margins continued to result in an overall positive impact on bank profitability (41%).\n",
